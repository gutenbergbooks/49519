<div class="maintitle">JIMMY-BOY</div>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>I<br />

<small>WASHINGTON-PIE</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> pepper-tree in the backyard nodded
its long, sweeping branches as if it were inviting
the little white burro to come and
stand in its shade.</p>

<p>The burro was coming, with Jimmy-boy on
his back and the dog Punch at his heels.</p>

<p>“Selim is always glad to get home,” said
John, the coachman, as he helped Jimmy-boy
down, and fastened the burro to the pepper-tree.</p>

<p>“Yes; he likes to switch flies,” said Jimmy,
patting Selim on the shoulder.</p>

<p>Jimmy was a fine, straight boy, with frank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
brown eyes and a pleasant smile. People
called him “a noble little fellow;” and so he
was on the whole, but he admired himself
rather too much. It was hard for him to
own that Jimmy Sanford Dunlee ever did
anything wrong. You will see this for yourself
as we go on with our story.</p>

<p>Jimmy-boy and Punch ran along to the
garden at the left of the house. Here was
a little pond with a stone wall around it.
It had been made there just to look pretty;
and water went into it from a long pipe
that lay under the ground.</p>

<p>Jimmy paused to converse with a horned
toad sitting half hidden under a black calla.
There were three or four horned toads near
the pond, all brought there by Jimmy-boy;
but this was the youngest, and his especial
pet. Jimmy had more than once saved the
gentle creature from being pounced upon by
Judy, the cat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>“I won’t let Judy get you if I can help
it, Jacky Horner. But if she comes, you
must hook her with your little horns, Jacky.
Now mind what I say!”</p>

<p>Jacky’s black eyes glistened like two
round beads. He did not try to run away
or hide; for he had learned that this small
boy who fed flies to him was his friend.</p>

<p>As Jimmy went toward the front veranda,
he heard a pleasant child-voice singing from
somewhere up in the air,—</p>

<p class="center">
“My bonnie sweet Jamie is all my joy.”<br />
</p>

<p>The voice was wee Lucy’s, and she was
singing a Scotch song which had been taught
her by her sister Kyzie. But where was
Lucy? Jimmy looked up to the tower windows,
but could see nothing of her.</p>

<p>“Where are you, Lucy?”</p>

<p>“Up here,” she answered.</p>

<p>“Up where?”</p>

<p>“Up in the sky.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>He looked again, and beheld his little sister
sitting high on the limb of a tall cypress-tree.
How had she got there? Jimmy was
startled; for it was all of a quarter of a
minute before he saw Mr. Henry Sanford,
who had hidden, laughing, behind the tree.
The young man had raised Lucy to her
lofty seat, and was now standing guard over
her.</p>

<p>“You never knew your little sister had
wings, did you, Jimmy-boy?” said he.</p>

<p>“I’ll have ’em when I go up to heaven,”
cried Lucy, “and I’ll fly this way!” spreading
out her little skirts, and waving her arms
above her head.</p>

<p>It was well that Mr. Sanford was there to
catch her before she fell.</p>

<p>“There! I wanted to get down awf’ly!”
she cried, as she landed on the grass. “I
<i>fink</i> that pie is done.”</p>

<p>“The Washington-pie,” explained Jimmy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
to Mr. Sanford. “It’s just a cake with
jelly in. I don’t know why folks call it a
pie. Vendla is making it for George Washington;
it’s his birthday to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you a little mistaken there, Jimmy?
To-morrow will be Fourth of July, not Washington’s
Birthday.”</p>

<p>“Oh, wasn’t he born to-morrow? I thought
papa said so,” said Jimmy, slowly following
Lucy, who had gone in search of the pie.</p>

<p>She had already bounded in at the back
door, and, finding no one in the kitchen, had
danced along to the pantry. There it was
on the shelf by the window. Not a pie,—a
lovely, plump brown cake. Some people were
coming visiting to-morrow, perhaps a good
many people, and Washington with them.
That was the reason the cake was so very
large, Lucy thought.</p>

<p>Was it cooling properly? The child hopped
about, making little exclamations, and thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Washington would like his cake, it was so
large and brown, and so slippery smooth.</p>

<p>“Tastes like choc-lid drops, I s’pose. No;
like candy-mels. Wish I knew how it does
taste.” She gazed and gazed. “Would mamma
care if I should touch it with my finger,—so,—my
littlest finger, just to see ’f it’s
hard? <i>I</i> wouldn’t hurt it any! Why, it’s
just as soft!”</p>

<p>Delightful discovery! And, being soft, a
scrap of it adhered to that littlest finger.
Only a <i>tiny</i> scrap. And pray, what could
Lucy do but put it in her mouth?</p>

<p>“<i>’Tis</i> like choc-lid drops. No; I don’t know—maybe
it’s like candy-mels. Can’t tell
’thout I have a bigger piece.”</p>

<p>The first hole had been no deeper than
the dimple in Lucy’s cheek; the next hole
went farther in. She was ready for the third
nibble when her brother entered the pantry.</p>

<p>“Lucy Lyman Dunlee!” he exclaimed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
“that’s a Fourth o’ July Washington-pie!
Made for company! Now you’ll catch it!”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t hurting Wash’ton’s Fourthy July
pie; ’course I wasn’t,” returned the little mischief
very innocently.</p>

<p>“I never saw such a girl. You’re as bad
as the captain’s monkey,” said Jimmy severely.
But he was not looking at Lucy; he
was looking at the pie. “Go right away and
let it alone! I suppose you don’t mean to
go, though. Why, how you <i>have</i> dented it
up!” Here Jimmy seized a knife, and made
a neat little dash at the frosting. “There,
<i>that</i> doesn’t leave any mark.”</p>

<p>A large bit was left on the knife, a much
larger one than Lucy had been able to secure.
She opened her mouth expectantly;
but, strange to say, the dainty morsel went
straight into Jimmy’s own mouth, not hers!</p>

<p>“Hello! that’s good,” said he. “I don’t
like frosting after it’s all dried up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nor me, either! Give <i>me</i> some!” pleaded
the little sister.</p>

<p>“There, take that; I’m only smoothing it
off. You were a naughty girl to touch it
in the first place. Maybe when you get as
old as I am you’ll have some sense. You
see,” he added, as he went on making repairs,
“I <i>have</i> to smooth it off, or mamma’ll
know what you’ve done, and you’ll get a
snipping.”</p>

<p>It was very interesting business “smoothing
it off;” it gave the children so many
chances to find out just how the frosting
tasted.</p>

<p>But alas! Jimmy’s knife made worse havoc
than Lucy’s finger had done. Though he
tried his best, it would leave deep tracks like
a wagon-wheel in the mud. Or you might
have fancied a dozen mischievous brownies
had been driving over that beautiful cake
pell-mell on their bicycles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>Jimmy, amazed and alarmed, gave it up at
last.</p>

<p>“No use,” said he. “For shame, Lucy
Dunlee!” and hid the “Fourth o’ July Washington-pie”
behind a pan, there to dry in
all its ugly roughness.</p>

<p>Vendla descried it that afternoon, and showed
it to her mistress. Vendla was the new girl,
a Swede, who had come after Molly was married.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dunlee summoned Jimmy-boy into the
pantry, and pointed out to him something
which looked like a huge mud-ball baked in
the sun. It was the ruins of the Washington-pie.
Jimmy was deeply mortified, but tried
to defend himself.</p>

<p>“’Twas Lucy began it, mamma. True’s the
world, ’twas Lucy! <i>Boys</i> don’t do such things.
She pitched right in and spoiled it, or I
wouldn’t ever ’a’ touched it.”</p>

<p>“James!” said his mother sternly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“I only tried to smooth it off, mamma, so
folks wouldn’t know folks had touched it. If
Lucy”—</p>

<p>“So because Lucy had picked off some of
the frosting, you must meddle with it too.
And now you throw all the blame on your
little sister! How shabby of you! Isn’t my
boy any more manly than this?”</p>

<p>Jimmy hung his head. It was dreadful not
to be a manly boy. He scowled at the cracks
in the floor, and thoroughly despised himself.</p>

<p>“I don’t see,” moaned he, laying his hand
with a gesture of despair on his chest, “I don’t
see how such mean things get into my”—he
paused, unable to think of the right word—“into
my—stomach.”</p>

<p>He meant his <i>heart</i>.</p>

<p>“I’m older’n Lucy is, and I’m a boy. She’s
only a girl! I think I was mean, awful mean,
mamma!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a great thing for Jimmy to own this.</p>

<p>“Well said, my son! I like that. But you
know you are apt to forget. You forgot twice
last week to be manly toward Lucy. Is there
any way to make you remember?”</p>

<p>Jimmy’s hand, which had been pressed upon
his heart, dropped suddenly. He hoped his
mother would not think it necessary to punish
him very much.</p>

<p>“If—if you don’t let me eat any of that
Fourth o’ July Washington-pie, mamma”—</p>

<p>“Certainly I shall forbid the pie at any
rate, because you meddled with it. But now
for being a coward, and saying, ‘’Twas Lucy;’
what ought we to do about <i>that</i>?”</p>

<p>“O mamma, mamma!” cried Jimmy in
alarm, “you wouldn’t take away my fire-crackers
and pin-wheels and things?—you
wouldn’t do it, mamma?”</p>

<p>“My precious boy! I couldn’t bear to deprive
you of the beautiful rockets and Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
candles which Mr. Sanford and your papa have
given you for the Fourth! There must be
some easier punishment; let us think.”</p>

<p>Jimmy looked relieved.</p>

<p>“Didn’t Aunt Vi give you some money to
spend for candy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, mamma; two bits,” (twenty-five
cents). “But I want it! Gilly Irwin is coming
in the morning to go to the candy stores
with me. O mamma, please!”</p>

<p>“But, my dear, if I should pass by your
faults you would forget them, and then you
wouldn’t improve. I really think you ought to
go without your Fourth of July candy.”</p>

<p>“Oh—Oh—Oh!”</p>

<p>“I shall not take away the money, however.
You may simply drop it in your
bank.”</p>

<p>Jimmy twisted his neck and twirled his
fingers, but said not a word.</p>

<p>Two people in this world were always right,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
he thought,—mamma and papa. Always
right, and never changed their minds; so it
wasn’t of the slightest use to tease.</p>

<p>But Fourth of July, and not a speck of
candy! Oh, dear!</p>

<h2>II<br />

<small>SEVEN PEPPERMINTS</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Gilbert Irwin</span> appeared at Mr. Dunlee’s
next morning, holding in his hand a tiny
lizard-skin purse, containing a dime and a
nickel.</p>

<p>“Come, Jimmy,” said he; “let’s go get our
candy.”</p>

<p>Before Jimmy could answer, the Chinese
vegetable man, Quon Wo, drove up to the
back door, calling out in a high, squealing
tone.—</p>

<p>“Platoes, <i>sleet</i> corn, cabbagee, spinny-gee!”</p>

<p>“What’s a spinny-gee? Give us a spinny-gee!”
laughed both the boys, running up to
Quon Wo, whom they knew very well.</p>

<p>“Go ’way! Too much, talkee, talkee!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>”
replied the Chinaman, grinning, and showing
nearly all his white teeth. At the same
time, being ready for a frolic, he pelted both
the boys with a handful of spinach.</p>

<p>Vendla stood in the doorway with a basket
and a pan. She bought potatoes and celery.
These went into her basket, and then she
held out the pan for something else.</p>

<p>Quon Wo knew what she wanted. He had
promised her some nice fresh ducks’ eggs;
and there they were, under the seat of the
cart in a pretty tea-chest.</p>

<p>“Duckee! Duckee!” said Quon Wo.
“Duckee heap good!” and counted out the
eggs into her pan, twelve of them, and then
drove away.</p>

<p>The boys would have run after him, but
Jimmy happened to remember why the ducks’
eggs had been spoken for. John wanted to
put them under a hen, to be hatched into
ducklings. And here came John, carrying in
his arms a white hen, squawking angrily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you must, Polly White; yes, you
must!” said John. “You’ve been wanting to
for a good while, and now we’re ready for
you. Come, Vendla, bring on your ducks’
eggs.”</p>

<p>Vendla went to the stable with the pan;
the little boys, the dog Punch and his friend
Toby, Mrs. Porter’s dog, close at her heels.
After the eggs had been put in a nice nest
of straw, John placed Mrs. White over them,
covering her up with a basket.</p>

<p>“Now stay there,” said John, “and see how
you like it.”</p>

<p>Polly was very young, and had never sat on
any eggs before. She had thought it would
be good fun; but when the basket was put
over her, she felt as if she should fly.
It was not pleasant to be shut up in the
dark.</p>

<p>“How long will she have to stay?” asked
Gilbert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>“Four weeks. ’Twill be easy keeping
count; four weeks from Fourth of July.”</p>

<p>The words “Fourth of July” reminded
Gilbert that he must buy his candy.</p>

<p>“Come, Jimmy,” said he, shaking his purse
up and down. He liked to hear the coins
jingle. “Where’s your purse, Jimmy?”</p>

<p>Jimmy drew out of his pocket a small, very
pretty mother-of-pearl portemonnaie, and
sighed as he opened it. It held a nickel
and a one-cent stamp.</p>

<p>“I can’t buy any candy to-day; but you
can buy yours all the same.”</p>

<p>“Why can’t you?”</p>

<p>“’Cause I can’t.”</p>

<p>“Oh, ho! been a bad boy?”</p>

<p>“Not much; not very; no!”</p>

<p>Then, as Gilly jingled his money again,
Jimmy added rather tartly,—</p>

<p>“Not half so bad as you are, Gilly
Irwin!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>“Me? Who said I’s bad?”</p>

<p>“Well, you are; but your mamma doesn’t
know it, and that’s why you don’t be punished.”</p>

<p>Gilly whistled. Perhaps he felt that there
was some truth in this.</p>

<p>“Your mamma punishes <i>you</i> more’n you
are naughty,” he said.</p>

<p>“Now you stop!” cried Jimmy. “My
mamma always finds out things. She isn’t
talking all the time with ladies in the parlor,
the way your mamma is.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw! You think you have the best
mamma and best papa and best everything!”
exclaimed Gilly.</p>

<p>“So I have!” said Jimmy confidently.</p>

<p>This was more than even the mild-tempered
Gilly could bear.</p>

<p>“<i>What</i> you mean? My papa is a major,
and yours isn’t!”</p>

<p>“H’m! My papa doesn’t want to be a major,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
and that’s why! Some people <i>perfers</i> to
be ministers!” Jimmy’s eyes were growing
fiery. “Don’t you know,” he went on, “ministers
are the nicest men there is in this
world?”</p>

<p>But Gilly refused to be crushed.</p>

<p>“Has your papa got a coat with gold
cushions on the shoulders, Jimmy Dunlee?
Does he go march, marching, when they beat
the drum?”</p>

<p>“No; he just despises to go march, marching!
He stays in his pulpit, I s’pose you
know!”</p>

<p>The foolish dispute might have gone on
much longer if Gilbert had not changed the
subject by saying,—</p>

<p>“I want some cocoanut taffy.”</p>

<p>But Gilly’s “candy-man” was away that
morning. He had just started with his wife
and children for a picnic.</p>

<p>Jimmy did not care very much.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>“See the folks, lots and lots of ’em, going
to Fourth o’ July,” said he. “You can’t get
any candy to-day, Gil Irwin.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I can. I know where I can get
some, better’n <i>you</i> ever saw. There are some
new ladies in that yellow house by the corner
that sell it. I went there the other day with
mamma, and got some.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go there, then,” said Jimmy.</p>

<p>They turned into a quiet street, and walked
three or four blocks, till they came to a pretty
buff cottage half covered with roses.</p>

<p>The “new ladies,”—really quite old ones,—had
lately bought it to live in; and of
course it was not a shop, and they kept nothing
to sell. Only, as it happened, they had
given Gilly a cake of maple-sugar the Thursday
before, when he called there with his
mamma.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t look a bit like a shop,” said
Jimmy, as they walked up to the front door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
of this quiet house, and Gilly pounded on the
screen-door. There was an electric bell at the
side. Jimmy did not think candy-shops generally
had electric bells. It was too late, however,
to turn back.</p>

<p>A sweet old lady came into the hall, looking
rather surprised. She naturally thought
that only rude children would pound in this
way for admission; yet these boys did not
look rude nor disrespectful.</p>

<p>“How do you do, my dears? Oh, this is
Gilbert Irwin, I think. But whom have you
brought with you, Master Gilly?”</p>

<p>“My name is James Sanford Dunlee,” replied
Jimmy, bowing low, hat in hand.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, the minister’s son. I’m glad to
see you both. Please walk in.”</p>

<p>Gilbert entered, followed slowly by Jimmy.</p>

<p>“Can you sell us some candy, ma’am?”
asked Gilly in a low voice. It was dawning
upon him that he had made some mistake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>“Candy? Did you think I kept it to sell?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Alvord smiled as she asked the question.
She was a gentle, graceful lady, all in
black. She had been putting on her bonnet
when the children knocked, and had not finished
tying the strings.</p>

<p>“I don’t keep candy to sell. You’ve come
to the wrong place, my dears.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Jimmy.</p>

<p>“Oh!” echoed Gilly, gazing regretfully at
his portemonnaie. He had kept it all the
while in his hand.</p>

<p>“Have you been trying to buy candy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am,” answered Gilly; “but the
candy-men ’most all have gone off to Fourth
o’ July.”</p>

<p>“What a pity!” said Mrs. Alvord. “I wish
I had some candy for you.”</p>

<p>“Come, Gilly,” whispered Jimmy, plucking
his companion by the sleeve. “Come, Gilly;
let’s go.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” said Mrs. Alvord. “My
sister, Mrs. Lewis, keeps peppermints sometimes
in a box on her bureau. Now, if peppermints
will only do?”</p>

<p>She had turned to go up the staircase.
Jimmy felt that it was not polite to give the
kind lady all this trouble; but before he could
think exactly what to say, or indeed whether
he ought to say anything at all, she was gone.</p>

<p>She soon returned, bearing in her hand a
pretty gilt-edged plate, on which were several
peppermints, pink and white.</p>

<p>“Just fourteen. I’m so glad there were
any left!” said she, smiling. “Mrs. Lewis
wishes she had a boxful. Now hold out your
hands, little boys, and I’ll divide. Seven for
you, Master Gilly, and seven for you, Master
Jamie.”</p>

<p>Gilbert had opened his lizard-skin wallet by
this time, and was offering Mrs. Alvord first
the nickel, and then the dime.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>“No; oh, no; keep your money, child! I
<i>give</i> you the peppermints.”</p>

<p>And she put half of them in his hand. He
dropped purse and coins on the hall carpet,
and for a minute forgot to say “Thank you.”</p>

<p>“And here are yours, Master James.”</p>

<p>But James did not hold out his hand.</p>

<p>“Don’t you like peppermints?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I thank you.”</p>

<p>“Then why not take them? Gilbert has
had his share.”</p>

<p>Jimmy dropped his eyes to the black ruffles
on the lady’s skirt, then turned shyly away.
Must folks <i>always</i> answer folks’ questions?
Yes; he had been taught that they must.
So, in a low voice, but, as I think, very
bravely, he replied,—</p>

<p>“Mamma told me not to buy any candy
to-day.”</p>

<p>“He’s been a naughty boy,” struck in Gilbert,
who certainly might have kept quiet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Alvord looked from one boy to the
other, her glance resting at last very kindly
on Jimmy.</p>

<p>“But, my dear, you are not <i>buying</i> this
candy; it is given you.”</p>

<p>Still Jimmy did not reach forth his hand.</p>

<p>“Ah! you really think you ought not to
take it? Then don’t do it by any means.
You are a noble, manly, little boy, James
Dunlee.”</p>

<p>Jimmy blushed for pleasure, but could not
raise his eyes. Oh, wasn’t it grand to be
called a manly boy!</p>

<p>“You may have been naughty once, but you
are good now, and I shall tell your mamma
so. I’m going to your house to dinner.”</p>

<p>Jimmy’s little face was radiant. Mamma
would know he was manly after all!</p>

<p>“And now shall I give the rest of the
peppermints to Gilbert?” asked Mrs. Alvord.</p>

<p>Gilbert took them eagerly, wondering why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Jimmy had refused them, and suspecting that
Jimmy did not care much for peppermints.</p>

<p>“That’s the ‘Jimmy-boy’ the blind Mrs.
Pope talks so much about. He is a boy to be
proud of,” said Mrs. Alvord, as she finished
tying her bonnet-strings before the glass in
her sister’s room.</p>

<p>“Dear little fellow!” returned Mrs. Lewis.
“I am so glad I shall see him to-day.”</p>

<h2>III<br />

<small>FOURTH OF JULY</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">All</span> this while wee Lucy was growing impatient.</p>

<p>“I fink Jimmy might come back,” said
she.</p>

<p>For she had a small tricycle, and he was
teaching her to ride.</p>

<p>“When will he come, Vendla?”</p>

<p>Vendla did not know. She thought he
might come by ten o’clock.</p>

<p>“Well, what’s <i>now</i> o’clock?”</p>

<p>“It’s half-past nine o’clock now.”</p>

<p>Lucy ran to the back parlor, and climbed
a chair that stood by the mantel. The pretty
marble clock was ticking its best; but she
thought it did not tick fast enough. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
opened the door of the clock, and moved the
black hands round.</p>

<p>“Now maybe ’twill strike,” she thought;
“and then he’ll come.”</p>

<p>It did strike, again and again, and yet again,
till the sweet cathedral chimes filled all the
air, and mamma came hurrying down-stairs to
see what had happened.</p>

<p>“Lucy, Lucy,” said she in a tone of displeasure,
“have you been touching the clock?”</p>

<p>“I <i>had</i> to make it strike, mamma, so my
Jimmy would come,” replied the little rogue,
scrambling down from the chair. “Are you
<i>in earnest</i>, mamma? Oh, I don’t want you to
be in earnest with your little girl!”</p>

<p>She looked in her mother’s face anxiously as
she spoke; and Mrs. Dunlee promised to forgive
her if she would never meddle with the
clock again.</p>

<p>“No, I won’t ever, mamma, ever any more.”</p>

<p>At that very moment Jimmy appeared.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Lucy ran up to him, laughing and crying;
laughing because she had brought him home
by making time go faster; crying because
mamma was “in earnest” with her little
girl.</p>

<p>“I’m all ready, and my dolly’s been all ready
for ever ’n’ ever. ’Most got the friz out of her
hair,” said Lucy reproachfully.</p>

<p>The brother and sister had a long ride, each
on a little tricycle; and Punch, who was in
attendance, could not have been prouder of his
little master and mistress if they had owned
the whole State of California and part of
Mexico.</p>

<p>Jimmy usually reproved Lucy for “doddlin’
round and wiggling so;” but was very patient
to-day, and said, “You do <i>pretty</i> well—for a
girl! Sometimes you do go so awful slow that
it tires me all out to keep up with you. Now
see <i>me</i>!”</p>

<p>And away he spun alone on his little wheel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
his sister gazing after him in wonder, admiration,
and despair.</p>

<p>They had both planned to give the baby a
“Fourthy July” ride in his own private carriage,
to the tune of,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Yankee Doodle came to town</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">On a Kentish pony;</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Stuck a feather in his hat,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And called it Maccaroni.”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But objections were made to this. Eddy
was young and tender, and could not stand
the jolting.</p>

<p>“H’m! <i>boys</i> can stand ’most anything,” said
Jimmy. “You’d think he was a girl, to hear
’em talk!”</p>

<p>“Glad he isn’t,” returned Lucy, patting
baby’s cheek. “I want him for a little brother.
What do I want of a little sister? <i>I’m</i> a
little sister <i>myse’f</i>!”</p>

<p>It was time now for dinner. There were
two guests in the parlor, Mrs. Alvord and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Mrs. Lewis. As Mrs. Alvord took Jimmy-boy’s
hand, she said,—</p>

<p>“May I kiss you on your cheek, Master
James? You don’t know how I wanted to
kiss you this morning!”</p>

<p>Jimmy offered both cheeks with a blush
and a smile. He was proud and happy to
be admired by this sweet lady; and he was
sure, too, that she had told, or was going to
tell, his mamma all about his call at “the
yellow house by the corner” with Gilly
Irwin.</p>

<p>“I am glad to know you too, Master
Jimmy-boy,” said Mrs. Lewis, a tall lady
with tiny white curls about her face. “Mrs.
Alvord and I love little children; but we have
none at our house, and your mamma has five.
I’m going to ask her if she can’t spare <i>us</i>
one,—you or Lucy or the baby. Which
do you think she would give away?”</p>

<p>Jimmy knew very well by the twinkle in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
the lady’s eye that this was only said in
sport. He reflected a moment, then replied,—</p>

<p>“It’s polite to give away the largest pieces
and things; so I think mamma ought to give
<i>me</i>!”</p>

<p>Both the ladies laughed, and thought this
a bright answer. Jimmy felt rather proud
of it himself, and looked around to see if
mamma had heard it. But Mrs. Dunlee was
not in the parlor.</p>

<p>She had stolen into her husband’s study
just for a moment, to tell him Mrs. Alvord’s
story of Jimmy-boy.</p>

<p>“A small thing, to be sure,” said she; “he
only gave up seven peppermints!”</p>

<p>“<i>Not</i> a small thing, my love,” returned
Mr. Dunlee. “It shows that the boy has
<i>character</i>. I am as happy about it as you.”</p>

<p>Jimmy thought it a remarkably pleasant dinner-party.
There was maccaroni soup, which
reminded Lucy at once of the singular sort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
of feather which “that Yankee Doodle boy”
had stuck in his cap.</p>

<p>“This is Yankee Doodle soup!” said she
in a loud whisper to her brother, who nearly
choked from trying not to laugh.</p>

<p>Sister Kyzie scowled darkly. When would
Lucy learn not to whisper at table? How
often must she be told to move her spoon
away from, and not towards, herself in taking
soup?</p>

<p>When the dessert came on, strange to say,
it was that same “Fourth-of-July-Washington-pie,”
no longer brown and ragged, but
shining as white as the far-off mountains at
Christmastide. What had Vendla done to
it? And why did mamma smile every moment?
Was she thinking how much fairer
the great cake looked now in this creamy
covering? Jimmy knew she was not thinking
of the cake!</p>

<p>After dinner he entertained Aunt Vi and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Mr. Sanford on the veranda by firing off a
round of crackers.</p>

<p>“Jimmy, Jimmy!” pleaded his aunt at last.
“If you’ll only be quiet a moment, I’d like
to show you something.”</p>

<p>She opened an old book, and he and Lucy
drew near to look at the picture of a man
in a military coat and cocked hat.</p>

<p>“I know who that is!” exclaimed Jimmy;
“that’s George Washington!”</p>

<p>“Right,” said Mr. Sanford; “the very man
you said Vendla made the pie for. And who
was he? What did he do?”</p>

<p>“What did he do?” repeated Jimmy. “Why,
I know that just as easy!”</p>

<p>Then, after a long pause,—</p>

<p>“Well, anyway he had a hatchet. No, no,”
seeing an amused look on Mr. Sanford’s face;
“’twas when he was little that he had the
hatchet! But afterwards he was—was he
the president?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes; our first president.”</p>

<p>Then Mr. Sanford told as simply as possible
what the good man did for us more
than a hundred years ago to make us a free
nation.</p>

<p>Jimmy listened carefully, and understood a
little of it. He was glad to learn that we
are free.</p>

<p>“I like to be free,” said he, swinging his
arms and throwing out his chest. “I like
to have a president ruling over me! Not
a queen, you know, away off in England!
That would be awful! Why, we should have
to sail to England in a ship every time we
wanted to ask the queen a question!”</p>

<p>“But here is little Lucy,” said Mr. Sanford,
“who looks as if she cares very little
about kings and queens. Perhaps she would
like to hear the story of the hatchet.”</p>

<p>Then he took her on his knee, and told
her how the little George Washington long,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
long ago had the present of a hatchet, and
enjoyed swinging it so well that he cut
down a small cherry-tree before he stopped to
think.</p>

<p>Lucy was very indignant. She loved trees,
and often stood and gazed up at them with
awe and delight. She was always angry when
she saw a man cut off the tops of eucalyptus
trees, even though she knew it was done to
make the trees grow broader and handsomer.</p>

<p>“Georgie was a naughty boy,” she said.
“I don’t like Georgie!”</p>

<p>“But,” said Mr. Sanford, “I told you how
sorry he was. Don’t you think children should
be forgiven when they are sorry?”</p>

<p>“I do,” returned Jimmy; “’specially when
they ‘<i>can’t tell a lie</i>!’”</p>

<p>Still Lucy was pitiless.</p>

<p>“They won’t have any more cherries at
that boy’s house—<i>ever</i>!”</p>

<p>And slipping down from Mr. Sanford’s knee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
she strode into the house without looking
back.</p>

<p>Mr. Sanford was sorry he had told her the
story.</p>

<p>“She doesn’t care much if George Washington
<i>couldn’t</i> tell a lie,” said Jimmy. “All
she cares about is the cherries.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps she thinks,” remarked Aunt Vi,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“‘If all the trees were cherry-trees,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And every little boy</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Should have, like young George Washington,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">A hatchet for his toy,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And use it in a way unwise,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">What should we do for cherry-pies?’”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>After tea the whole family, with the guests,
Mrs. Alvord and Mrs. Lewis, met on the
veranda to watch the glorious sunset.</p>

<p>“In a few minutes we shall see the fireworks
shooting up from the city,” said Mr.
Sanford; “and then we’ll light up our own
fireworks, Jimmy-boy, in honor of this free
country.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>So saying, he made a deep bow to the
American flags that hung in clusters all
about the veranda.</p>

<p>Jimmy’s eyes shone. He had lived in this
free country for five years and a half, and
had never known till to-day that it was free!
He thought of a bird let out of a cage, of
a poor wild gopher let out of a trap. What
a splendid thing it is to fly or run, just as
one chooses!</p>

<p>He looked at his treasures of fireworks
lying beside him on the floor, and smiled.
Ever so many boys were coming to see him
send up these beautiful flaming pictures into
the air. He should tell the boys,—maybe
they didn’t know,—he should tell them he
did it because this country is free!</p>

<p>Wee Lucy sat on a stool with a book in
her hand. She cared very little about freedom
or fireworks or “Fourthy July.” She
was scowling at a picture in the twilight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s Georgie; that’s the hatchet-man!”
said she wrathfully, and would have picked
out both his eyes with a pin if Aunt Vi had
not stopped her.</p>

<p>“Well, he’s awful! Bad man! Bad man!
Is he alive, Auntie?”</p>

<p>“No, dear; the good Washington died long,
long ago.”</p>

<p>Lucy clapped her hands in glee.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so glad, so glad!”</p>

<p>“What! Glad the good Washington is
dead?”</p>

<p>“Yes; ’cause now he can’t come here. I
was afraid he’d come to my house with his
hatchet, and cut down some o’ my trees!”</p>

<p>She seemed so relieved that they all laughed;
how could they help it? But no one undertook
to correct her opinion of the “father
of his country.”</p>

<p>“No use talking to her, she’s such a little
goose,” thought Jimmy-boy. “Wait till she’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
as old as I am, and she’ll know all about
it.”</p>

<p>But now the sun had fairly dropped behind
the wrinkled mountains; the city fireworks
had begun to play, and Jimmy’s fingers were
tingling to be at work on his rockets.</p>

<p>What a grand affair! How the neighbors,
large and small, were flocking to that veranda,
and with them half the dogs in town!
Which rose higher and jollier, the human or
the canine voices, it would have been hard to
tell.</p>

<p>But there were silent guests too. Three
horned toads sat near by, fastened by strings
to three stakes. Jimmy had tied them before
tea, to make sure they would have a good
time “seeing the sights.” They did see the
sights, and their beady eyes blinked in the
light; but if they had a good time they kept
it all to themselves.</p>

<p>Whiz! Fizz! Up soared Jimmy’s fireworks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the finest ever had in town. First pin-wheels.
But that was nothing; after that began the
real business, the grand display.</p>

<p>Each firework was a picture all by itself;
and such shouting and clapping you never
heard. But last and best of all was a picture,
in gold and silver fire, of a large, grand man
in a soldier’s uniform and cocked hat.</p>

<p>“’Rah! ’Rah! George Washington!” shouted
Jimmy. “Take off your hats! He’s the father
of his country.”</p>

<p>Then every hat came off, and every handkerchief
was waved, till the noble figure of
Washington faded into a shower of gold-dust,
and made a path of glory along the evening
sky.</p>

<h2>IV<br />

<small>WAS IT JUDY?</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a week or two after Polly White had
begun to sit on the ducks’ eggs, Lucy asked
every day,—</p>

<p>“Where’s my little duckies?”</p>

<p>And then she forgot all about them.</p>

<p>But Polly White was still sitting. It takes
only three weeks to hatch chickens; but it
takes four weeks to hatch ducklings, and poor
Polly did not understand it, and was growing
very tired. To keep up her spirits John and
Vendla gave her all sorts of nice things to
eat.</p>

<p>At last one day the ducklings began to peck
out of the shell. And when they fairly came
out how funny they looked! Very large and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
yellow, with round bills and yellow, flat feet;
and when they tried to walk they waddled.</p>

<p>Polly looked surprised. Were they all lame?
Had they all sprained their ankles? She had
never seen any ducklings before; but she
clucked just as proudly for all that.</p>

<p>“See my children! Aren’t they beauties?
That’s a new style of walking. Isn’t it sweet?”</p>

<p>Kyzie and Edith and Jimmy and Lucy
came out to see the funny brood. Vendla
set a pan of corn-meal dough near the back
door. Polly was very hungry; but she would
not touch one mouthful till she had called
her little ones to breakfast. There were nine
of them, and they dipped in their round bills
like spoons.</p>

<p>“That’s a new style of eating,” clucked
Polly. “Don’t you admire it?”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose Polly White thinks those
creatures are chickens?” asked Edith.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said John, who was looking on;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
“of course she does, and very cute chickens
too. You see, they belong to her.”</p>

<p>After their breakfast they rolled up their
eyes, and John said,—</p>

<p>“Now guess what they’re thinking about.”</p>

<p>No one could guess, and John had to answer
his own question.</p>

<p>“They’re thinking they want to swim.”</p>

<p>“Do you believe it?” said Kyzie. “What
do they know about swimming? They never
saw any water.”</p>

<p>There was a monstrous clay jar on the back
veranda in which water was always kept
cooling; it was called an <i>olla</i> (pronounced
<i>oya</i>.) But the ducklings could not have
peeped into that. Kyzie was right when she
said “they never saw any water.”</p>

<p>Still these yellow fuzz-balls had made up
their minds that there was water somewhere
in the world, and they meant to waddle,
waddle, till they found it. Nobody had ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
told them there was a pond in the garden;
but they ran that way as fast as their web-feet
could carry them. Their stepmother, Mrs.
White, ran after, anxious to stop them; but
the moment they saw the water they tried to
go in. They could not climb up the wall.
John took them in his hands, one by one,
and dropped them into the pond.</p>

<p>Then they were happy. This was the very
thing they had been dreaming about as they
lay asleep in their egg-shell cribs!</p>

<p>But poor Polly! How frightened she was!
How she flapped her wings and squawked!
She thought her children had gone crazy;
she was sure they would drown.</p>

<p>No, not they! They struck out their little
feet like paddles, held up their heads, and
rowed that pond as if they were giving lessons
in swimming. The children all clapped
their hands at the gay sight, and Jimmy
cried,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>“Cheer, boys, cheer!”</p>

<p>After a little, Mrs. Polly grew calmer, and
began to chuck again,—</p>

<p>“Those are my chickens; they’re all in the
swim! See their new style of feet!”</p>

<p>Still she did not feel quite easy.</p>

<p>Just then Quon Wo, the Chinaman, drove
along, calling out, “<i>Sleet</i> corn, cabbagee,
spinney-gee.”</p>

<p>When he found what was going on, he
shook his head till his long black cue danced
over his shoulders.</p>

<p>“No so!” he cried. “No <i>so</i>! Lil duckee
no slim-ee!” (Little ducks mustn’t swim.)</p>

<p>“Why not?” said John. “See how easy
they go.”</p>

<p>But Quon Wo still shook his cue. He
thought they ought not to swim yet without
a mother-duck who would know how to oil
their feathers for them. The stepmother hen
could not do this. “Wait till they are a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
month old before they swim,” was the advice
of Quon Wo.</p>

<p>“Well, if you’re going to be so fussy about
it, Quon Wo, I’ll take ’em out,” said John.</p>

<p>And he did. So the fun was all spoiled;
at least for this time.</p>

<p>John, Vendla, and the children went into the
house. Vendla put on her sweeping-cap, and
began to sweep the chambers, while Jimmy
and Lucy strayed off to the kitchen.</p>

<p>On the long table against the kitchen wall
stood an elegant china fruit-dish which Vendla
had brought out from the parlor to wash.</p>

<p>“Pretty dish,” said Lucy, fingering the
edges lovingly.</p>

<p>“Let that alone, or you’ll break it,” said
Jimmy, in the tone of command he often used
when speaking to his little sister.</p>

<p>Lucy did not obey at once.</p>

<p>“You’re the naughtiest child, Lucy Lyman
Dunlee! You’ll go and break that, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
they’ll go and blame <i>me</i>! I <i>always</i> get punished
for <i>you</i>!”</p>

<p>Jimmy pitied himself as he heard his own
words.</p>

<p>“Yes, Lucy Lyman Dunlee, you’re the awfulest
acting-est child!</p>

<p>“If you don’t stop picking cake, and spoiling
things, and breaking things, I’ll—I’ll—why,
they’ll think it’s <i>me</i>! and I’ll grow up
to be despised!”</p>

<p>Lucy sprang away from the table in alarm.
What it was to “grow up to be despised” she
had no idea. Something bad, if it made
Jimmy look like this!</p>

<p>“There comes Judy! What has she got in
her mouth?” cried Jimmy, forgetting his fear
of being “despised.” “It can’t be one of
Polly’s chickens?”</p>

<p>With that, he and Lucy began to chase the
cat about the room. Judy thought it hardly
fair to have two children after her at once, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
jumped into a chair, and from the chair to the
table.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 512px;">
<img src="images/i059.jpg" width="512" height="502" alt="china dish broken on floor while Lucy and Jimmy look at it" />
<div class="caption">“Who did that?” cried Jimmy.<br />

<div class="attrib"><i><a href="#Page_57">Page 57.</a></i></div></div>
</div>

<p>“She’s smelling the china dish with her
nose. Come down; come down!” said Lucy.</p>

<p>Judy did not come, but continued to sniff
at the dish.</p>

<p>“Stop that!” said Jimmy. “Come down, or
I’ll pull you down!”</p>

<p>In a frolicsome mood he caught her by the
tail, not roughly or unkindly. He had been
taught gentleness to animals; but somehow in
dragging her backward the fruit-dish got in the
way. Perhaps Judy’s paw touched it, perhaps
Jimmy’s elbow. Yes, it was probably Jimmy’s
elbow. At any rate, the dish was overturned;
and as it fell to the floor it broke in half a
dozen pieces.</p>

<p>“Who did that?” cried Jimmy in dismay.
He had not been aware of touching the dish.
It was certainly an accident; still he was old
enough to know that he was to blame for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
accident. He should not have played with the
cat while her nose was in the fruit-dish.</p>

<p>Yet he was the good boy who had just been
scolding his little sister for nothing at all!
The good boy who never did wrong!</p>

<p>“Oh, that beau’-ful dish!” sighed Lucy.
“Poor mamma’ll feel <i>so</i> bad!”</p>

<p>“Well, ’twas the cat did it,” said Jimmy
quickly.</p>

<p>His forehead was full of wrinkles; his eyes
were full of tears. Lucy always made ready
to cry when he cried, and now she turned up
the corner of her apron; and for half a minute
the room was so still that you could almost
have heard a fly walking on the roller-towel.</p>

<p>Jimmy stood on one foot and thought: “I’ll
go tell mamma I didn’t mean to. No; I’ll tell
her Judy did it. Judy did, I <i>think</i>.”</p>

<p>The fly on the towel gazed at Jimmy;
Jimmy gazed at the fly.</p>

<p>“Mamma’s pretty dish,” said Lucy, breaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the silence. Jimmy was not crying, so she
dropped the corner of her apron.</p>

<p>“Judy broke it,” declared Jimmy again.</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented the little sister; “Judy
broked it.”</p>

<p>“Well—go tell mamma so. I hear her in
the parlor.”</p>

<p>Lucy turned to go.</p>

<p>“No, don’t; I don’t want you to. Needn’t
tell mamma anything.”</p>

<p>“No; needn’t tell her anyfing,” said Lucy,
whirling about, and looking at her brother.</p>

<p>She and the little fly both looked at him.
Lucy did not know any more than the fly
what was going on in Jimmy’s mind. Neither
of them dreamed it was a battle between right
and wrong.</p>

<p>“If I run out to the garden, won’t that be
the best way? Then Vendla’ll come in, and
she’ll think the cat broke it. I’ll shut the cat
in here all alone,” thought this little soldier,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
who was fighting a battle between right and
wrong. “It will not be same as a lie,—I
<i>think</i> not.”</p>

<p>Jimmy moved towards the back door, and
there he stood quite still.</p>

<p>Why did Lucy stare at him so, as if she
were watching to see him make up his mind?</p>

<p>“Lucy Lyman Dunlee, what makes you look
so awful sober? Just as if papa was dead,
and mamma had been hooked by a cow? Why
don’t you go out-doors and see—see where
Polly White is?”</p>

<p>Lucy was gone in a twinkling, glad to get
away from Jimmy, who was scowling now “as
fierce as ten furies.”</p>

<p>He looked at the door, then at the cat.
“Wish I was little like Lucy; <i>then</i> it wouldn’t
be wrong. No matter what you do when you’re
little like Lucy.”</p>

<p>Jimmy sighed.</p>

<p>“Babies like her! <i>They</i> don’t have to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
gentlemen. But when you’re a boy, and getting
so big—</p>

<p>“Did George Washington ever shut up a
cat? George Washington wouldn’t do it. ‘<i>I
can’t tell a lie</i>,’ says George Washington. No,
<i>sir</i>!”</p>

<p>This seemed to settle the question for Jimmy.
The ‘<i>No, sir!</i>’ sounded as loud as a
cannon-ball, though even the cat did not hear.
The words were spoken only in Jimmy’s
heart.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said he again, and ran for the
parlor as if a mountain-lion were chasing him.
He dared not walk, lest he might not go at all.</p>

<p>How he hated to go! That fruit-dish was a
new one only last Christmas. Mamma would
almost cry to know it was broken.</p>

<p>He ran every step of the way. Mamma almost
cried, it is true; but it was just for joy!</p>

<p>“My blessed, blessed Jimmy-boy! I can forgive
you for carelessness; but, oh, if you <i>had</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
shut Judy into the kitchen, and deceived your
mother!”</p>

<p>“But I didn’t do it, mamma!”</p>

<p>“No, no, no; God kept you from that meanness,
the good God.”</p>

<p>“Mamma, your beautiful fruit-dish is broken!”
exclaimed Edy, bursting into the parlor.
“Isn’t it too bad?”</p>

<p>“Never mind, daughter; I’m too happy to
care for such trifles,” returned Mrs. Dunlee,
with a sunny glance at Jimmy that warmed
him to the very depths of his heart.</p>

<h2>V<br />

<small>MRS. BIDDY CHICK</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Quon Wo decided that the ducklings
were old enough, they were allowed to swim.
But Polly never let them go to the pond alone.
She went with them, and stood on dry land,
watching their graceful motions. She seemed
to feel ashamed not to swim herself; but she
knew there was something the matter with
her feet, so she never tried to learn.</p>

<p>“I don’t want Judy to catch any of those
ducklings,” said Jimmy; “Judy’s horrid sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Will Punch catch any, do you think?”
asked Mr. Sanford.</p>

<p>“Punch!” cried Jimmy indignantly. “Punch
isn’t horrid; he’s good.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“He’s a nice shepherd dog,” said Mr. Sanford,
patting the animal’s head. “But he’s
young yet. Let me see, how long have you
had Punch?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you remember, Mr. Sanford? I
should think you’d remember. ’Twas that time
I had the toothache, and Aunt Vi made some
walnut creams. It ached and ached. Mamma
said I must go to the dentist. I didn’t like
to; I was afraid. But Aunt Vi said, ‘Now
you go with me, Jimmy, and I’ll write and
tell Mr. Sanford.’ ’Twas when you were gone.
Where were you gone, Mr. Sanford?”</p>

<p>“I was at Los Angeles.”</p>

<p>“Well, so I went to the dentist with Auntie.
She said I was brave. Boys don’t cry, you
know; not much. The thing the dentist
pulled with was as sharp as the head of a
pin,—no, the <i>point</i> of a pin. But when the
tooth came out it never ached any more after
that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>“And then Aunt Vi wrote to you; don’t you
know? And you said you’d send me a present
in a bag, and it would come that day to the
post-office, and we must go right off and get it.
I never guessed what it was; nobody could
guess.</p>

<p>“How I laughed! how papa laughed! It
was a great, strong bag. There, turn your
head round, Punch! He had a blue ribbon
round his neck then. Who would have
thought he came in that bag? But he did.
Didn’t you, Punch?</p>

<p>“He wasn’t half as big then as he is
now. He never died at all. No, Punch, you
breathed all the time just the same. And
when we took you out of the bag you were
as alive as could be, and wanted some bread
and milk.”</p>

<p>Punch wagged his tail at this story as if he
remembered it all.</p>

<p>“That was last March, if I’m not mistaken,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
said Mr. Sanford. “And Punch was then six
months old. That would make him a year old
now.</p>

<p>“Well, he’s not very handsome, but he
is a knowing dog. I think you did a
good thing when you had that tooth out,
Jimmy.”</p>

<p>Jimmy’s head rose a little higher.</p>

<p>“Well, and I told mamma I was willing to
go to the dentist again, for it didn’t hurt much.
But mamma said I needn’t go again; ’twas no
use to pull out my teeth when they didn’t
ache. And, besides, I don’t want any more
dogs, you know. What do I want of more
dogs when I have Punch?</p>

<p>“Punch, come here! When you lick my
hand so, and tickle me, I have to laugh. But
he doesn’t look as if he came in a bag, does
he, Mr. Sanford?”</p>

<p>Punch pricked up his ears, and began to
bark. His big friend Toby across the way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Mrs. Porter’s dog, was barking, and little
Punch never let Toby make more noise than
he did if he could help it. Toby had espied
a wagon coming up the hill. Very soon Punch
saw it too through the trees, and then he knew
what he had been barking about.</p>

<p>Dear, merry Mrs. Chick was in the wagon.
She had come to town to buy her a dress, she
said. And where was her little Lucy?</p>

<p>Lucy soon appeared on her tricycle, to the
great delight of Mrs. Chick.</p>

<p>“I like to see the ducklings swim,” she
said; “but it isn’t half so pretty a sight as my
little girl dancing along on that fizzy-me-jig
wheel with all sails flying.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Chick wanted to take two of the children
home with her to stay all night, and Edith
and Jimmy were only too glad to be allowed to
go.</p>

<p>“This time I may churn butter, mayn’t I,
Mrs. Chick?” said Jimmy. “You always said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
I might churn butter some time in that pretty
green churn.”</p>

<p>“So you shall, if you get up early enough,
my boy; so you shall,” said the good-natured
woman cheerily. “The cream will be all
ready in the morning by five o’clock. Do you
like to get up at five o’clock?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Maybe I do, if you’ll call
me, Mrs. Chick.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Chick lived several miles away, on a
ranch or farm. If her ranch had been all
paid for she would have been a rich woman.
She had lemon-trees, and a little lemon-house
to dry the lemons in; she had orange and
fig and olive trees, and so many different kinds
of roses that she couldn’t remember all their
names to save her life. The palm-trees had
trunks that looked like enormous pine-apples.
One queer tree with rough bark was called
a “monkey-tree.” Mrs. Chick said she didn’t
know why, unless it was because a monkey
couldn’t climb it!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>“No,” said Edy; “the needles and thorns on
it would prick and scratch him awfully. I’d
like to see the captain’s monkey try to climb
it. How he would cry!”</p>

<p>The young Dunlees never failed to have a
good time at Mrs. Chick’s. She lived alone,
and had a funny way of talking to herself,
and asking,—</p>

<p>“Do you hear what I say, Biddy Chick?”</p>

<p>Her first name was Bridget.</p>

<p>Then, too, she kept numerous pet animals,
which she caressed and talked to almost like
children. Somebody had just given her
three bits of motherless tortoise-shell kittens;
and it was interesting to see her feed them.
She had a bottle of milk with a quill in it;
and, taking one kitty on her lap at a time,
she said, “Now, my pretty baby,” and put the
quill in its mouth. When the “pretty baby”
had sucked all the milk that it ought to have,
she put it down and took up another baby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>The beautiful little creatures were just beginning
to see; and what they thought of
their large, fat mother and the bottle with
a quill in it I cannot say. But they always
ate heartily, and afterwards rolled themselves
up in little balls close together on a cushion,
and went to sleep in the sun, looking perfectly
happy.</p>

<p>There was another pet, a playful young kid
with a brass collar on his neck, who trotted
about on his little black feet, following his
mistress everywhere, even into the parlor.
He, too, had been brought up on a bottle,
and his name was Trot.</p>

<p>Mrs. Chick had two cows, a horse, and many
hens and turkeys. She sometimes took the
turkeys with her when she went visiting.
Then there was a two years’ old baby over
the way, who was always dancing in and out,
and making a good deal of trouble; so Mrs.
Chick was seldom lonely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>The children kept thinking what a lovely
time they were having; but after tea they
both felt tired, and at seven o’clock Mrs.
Chick sent Jimmy to bed. The chamber was
unfinished, and had no paper or plaster, and
in some places the ceiling was so low that
even little Jimmy could hardly stand upright.
There was a live-oak tree close to the window,
and he had seen a bird’s nest in the
branches of the tree.</p>

<p>“I’ll hear the birds singing before I wake
up,” thought Jimmy drowsily. “And I’ll go
straight to sleep, for I’m going to churn
that butter in the morning.”</p>

<p>But Jimmy did not go straight to sleep, nor
did he waken early; and I will tell you why.</p>

<p>After he had gone up-stairs Mrs. Chick
lighted a lamp and sat down in the kitchen
to mend stockings, while Edith sat near her,
looking over a picture-book. Presently Mrs.
Chick said,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“Dear me! I forgot to bring down that
maple-sirup. I meant to have it for the
waffles in the morning. But no matter now;
I won’t stop to go after it.”</p>

<p>“Is it up-stairs?” asked Edith, who thought
that it would be quite too bad to eat waffles
without sirup.</p>

<p>“Yes; up-stairs in the closet in the northeast
room. I keep it there because it’s a cool
place. I used to keep it in the pantry, but
the Morse baby always found out where to
look for it. She climbs everywhere.”</p>

<p>“I think that Morse baby is more trouble
than the kid,” said Edith. “But can’t I go
up and get the sirup, Mrs. Chick? I’d like
to so much.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Chick considered. She was tired, and
did not wish to go herself; but could Edy
be trusted with a lamp?</p>

<p>“Just hand down that candle from the mantel-piece,
Edy. There,” said she, after lighting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
it, “that’s safe enough! The pitcher is
right on the closet floor, under the lowest
shelf, behind a box. Will you be very sure
not to carry the candle into the closet?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, indeed! Oh, <i>yes</i>, indeed, I mean!
And I’ll be, oh, so careful!”</p>

<p>“Well, if you’ll remember to set the candle
down by the chamber door, I think there’ll
be no danger.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mrs. Chick, I will,” said Edith, and
danced away joyfully. It was almost an unheard-of
thing for her to be trusted with a
light, and she enjoyed it. She held the candle
aloft, and peered rather cautiously about
the unfinished room next door to Jimmy’s.
The whole house was so queer, she thought,
and Mrs. Chick put things in such droll
places.</p>

<p>“If mamma knew I had this candle she’d
be nervous. She talks to me about lamps
and things as if I was a baby; but I guess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
she’ll find out I know as much as Kyzie.
Kyzie singed her hair once. Father thinks
I can’t take care. I mind all that’s said to
me; I mind beautifully.</p>

<p>“Now, I wouldn’t forget what Mrs. Chick
told me about this candle, not for anything!
She told me to set it down by the closet
door!”</p>

<p>Ah, Edith, a mistake already! She told
you the chamber door!</p>

<p>“I remember a great deal better than Gertie
Mercer. She can’t remember eight times
nine to save her life. Let’s see, the pitcher’s
on the closet floor behind a box.”</p>

<p>She opened the closet door, the candle still
in her hand. What a delicious odor of apricots
and peaches! Did Mrs. Chick keep her
fruit here too? Such a funny woman!</p>

<p>Edith set her candle down by the closet
door, and knelt just in front of it, the bottom
of the candlestick almost touching the skirt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
of her frock! But as she peered into the
closet she forgot there was anything in the
world but a sirup pitcher and some apricots
and peaches. That candlestick with the candle
in it was as far away from her thoughts, to say
the least, as the moon in the sky.</p>

<p>But the candle did not forget. It is the
duty of a lighted candle to set fire to anything
that is put in its way; and presently,
when Edith by a quick movement thrust her
skirt right into the flame of the candle, what
could you expect but a blaze?</p>

<p>Before Edith could explore the closet floor
and take out the sirup pitcher, the blaze was
creeping up the back of her frock. She knew
nothing about it till the smell of burning
woollen reached her nostrils; and at the same
instant she felt a dreadful sensation of heat,
and knew that she was on fire! She screamed
in horror,—</p>

<p>“Mrs. Chick! Mrs. Chick! Fire! Fire!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Oh, how far it was down-stairs! Could Mrs.
Chick hear?</p>

<p>But Mrs. Chick was not in the kitchen.
Feeling rather uneasy about Edith, she had
followed her up-stairs, and was on the upper
landing when the child called. She heard
the first cry, and came at once to her aid,
followed by Jimmy.</p>

<p>I rejoice to say that the flames had not
reached Edith’s hair. Mrs. Chick wrapped her
in her best rug, which was quite spoiled by
the means, to say nothing of the little girl’s
pretty red frock; but the dear child herself
was unharmed.</p>

<h2>VI<br />

<small>JIMMY’S BUTTER</small></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Don’t</span> cry so, you dear little girl; there
is no harm done,” said Mrs. Chick. “Why,
Jimmy-boy! I wish you were asleep. Run
right back to bed, and don’t be so scared.
Sister wasn’t hurt a bit.”</p>

<p>All this while Mrs. Chick, having undressed
Edith, was rocking her in her arms
like a baby.</p>

<p>“I was a naughty, heedless girl,” said
Edith. “I ought to have told you mamma
never trusts me with any kind of a light except
a taper in a tumbler. But I thought I
was going to be so careful this time.”</p>

<p>“’Twas all my fault, dearie. I knew you
weren’t one of the stop-to-think kind. You’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
learn by and by,” replied Mrs. Chick soothingly,
as she placed the trembling, exhausted
child in bed between lavender-scented sheets,
and turned to leave her.</p>

<p>“’Twas all my fault,” repeated the good
woman to herself. “Thank Heaven no harm
came of it! but I should think I was old
enough to know better. I’m so weak-minded
about children; can’t deny ’em anything they
ask for!</p>

<p>“Now, there’s that cream. I’ve no business
to let Jimmy churn it to-morrow morning.
Something will happen to it, as sure as my
name’s Biddy Chick; and I can’t afford to
lose the cream. It needs a steady hand to
bring butter, and I’ll do the churning myself
before he wakes up.”</p>

<p>After this exciting adventure with the candle,
it was some time before the children
could compose themselves to go to sleep. Mrs.
Chick had planned to do an unusual amount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
of work next day, and wanted an early breakfast;
but she had not the heart to waken
her young guests.</p>

<p>“Let ’em have a good rest, poor little
things! I remember how I used to hate to be
called up when I was a child; though, to be
sure, I knew I’d got to work, and that makes
a difference. Bless me! how I did have to
work!”</p>

<p>It was eight o’clock, and the sun was quite
high, when the children sat down to their
breakfast of omelet and waffles. The maple-sirup
had been forgotten after all, and Mrs.
Chick had to go up-stairs for it.</p>

<p>“I’ve saved the cream for you to churn,
Master Jimmy,” said she, watching his smiles
as she spoke.</p>

<p>“I ought to have got it out of the way by
half-past five, and all made into balls; but I
don’t have a nice little boy like you come
visiting me every day, and I can’t bear to
disappoint you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thank you, Mrs. Chick,” said Jimmy.</p>

<p>He supposed it would be nothing but fun
to make butter, and secretly hoped he might
be allowed to pat it into balls.</p>

<p>After breakfast he followed his kind hostess
into the shed, and saw her pour a jar of
rich cream into the green churn. She placed
a chair for Jimmy beside the churn.</p>

<p>“All you’ve got to do,” said she, “is to
turn the handle of the churn ’round and
’round and ’round.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s nothing; I can do it just as
easy,” replied Jimmy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Chick laughed.</p>

<p>“It’s harder than you think, little dear.
But when you are tired of it you can let me
know. I shall be close by in the kitchen,
making pies.”</p>

<p>“Look here! see what I’m doing! You
never churned any butter, now did you,
Edy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>“No,” said Edith; “and I don’t want to.
I’d rather help Mrs. Chick make pies.”</p>

<p>For two minutes Jimmy was triumphant.</p>

<p>“How easy it goes! How well I do it!”
he thought. “My arms must be pretty
strong.”</p>

<p>But nobody was there to hear or see him.
Mrs. Chick had gone into the kitchen, and was
talking to Edith about buttering the plates for
the pies. Through the open shed door he espied
the kid nibbling leaves from some low
bushes. The little Morse baby, who never
stayed at home if she could help it, had
brought her black doll just inside Mrs. Chick’s
yard, and was rolling her in the sand.</p>

<p>“What a dirty baby to do that!” thought
Jimmy.</p>

<p>Still he almost wished she would come into
the shed; he did not enjoy being alone.</p>

<p>He turned the handle of the churn ’round
and ’round and ’round. He was growing tired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mrs. Chick!” he called out, “I think the
butter is done.”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Chick paid no attention. She was
telling Edy how hard she used to work when
she was a little girl named Biddy Roberts, and
lived in England.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said she to Edy, “they wouldn’t
have called me Biddy if they had known I
was going to marry a man by the name of
Chick!”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Chick!” called Jimmy again.</p>

<p>“Well, what is it, dear?” said she from the
kitchen.</p>

<p>“The butter’s done, I guess. Will you
please come and see if the butter is done?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Chick was very busy. She had put
some pie-crust on a deep plate, and was scalloping
the crust into a kind of high wall all
around the plate, ready to hold a rich custard.</p>

<p>“I think it’s done; I do truly,” repeated
Jimmy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, sonny; the butter can’t have come
yet. What are you doing? Don’t take off
the cover of the churn, Jimmy-boy. Only
keep on turning the handle ’round and ’round
and ’round.”</p>

<p>“Why, that’s just what I did do! Why,
I’ve turned it ’round forty-two hundred times.
I know I have. Can’t I stop now and get a
drink of water?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Chick laughed. She was a woman who
laughed very easily.</p>

<p>“Yes; get some water if you like.”</p>

<p>There was a large olla (oya) in one corner
of the shed, covered by a white soup-plate.
The water in it was always cold. Jimmy left
the churn at once, and went to the olla, and
stood to take a long breath. Then he ran to
the pantry for a tumbler; he did not like to
drink from the tin dipper which sat in the
soup-plate.</p>

<p>But while he was gone for the tumbler, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Morse baby slipped into the shed, making
hardly any noise. She came in with that
dirty, dirty doll, as full of sand as a pepper-box
is full of pepper. She climbed into Jimmy’s
chair, lifted the cover off the churn, which was
only set on edgewise, and said, “Diny, oo go
in dare!”</p>

<p>And then she plumped Dinah head-first into
the churn.</p>

<p>Nobody heard or saw her. What made her
do it? It is of no use trying to guess. She
might have thought such a sandy doll ought
to have a bath. Or perhaps she was making
believe Dinah had been naughty, and she was
shutting her up in the closet.</p>

<p>At any rate, as soon as the miserable black
object was safe in the churn, Baby Morse ran
away to chase the kid, and forgot all about her
doll.</p>

<p>When Jimmy had drunk two tumblers of
water, and rested a long while,—for he was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
in the least haste,—he went back to the
churn.</p>

<p>The cover was off.</p>

<p>“I did not know I took that off,” said he.
And he put it on again quickly.</p>

<p>Then he turned the handle ’round and ’ro-ound
and ’ro-o-ound. But how ha-rd it went!
Much harder than before. How heavy the
cream had grown all at once! Mrs. Chick
had warned Jimmy that it would seem to
grow very heavy at the last.</p>

<p>“Do come, Mrs. Chick!” he cried eagerly.
“The butter’s done now. I know it’s done.
It breaks my arm off to turn it ’round.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Chick had just put her second pie
into the oven. She went out to the shed,
wondering what Jimmy meant, for she was
sure the butter had not come. She took off
the cover of the churn and looked in.</p>

<p>“Why! what’s this?” cried she.</p>

<p>She put in her hand then, and drew out
that dirty, dirty doll.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>She could not help laughing, though she
was very sorry. It was quite too bad to spoil
so much cream, and she was by no means
a rich woman.</p>

<p>“I’m glad I didn’t put in all my cream,”
she thought. “I had sense enough to save
out half of it.”</p>

<p>But she was just as much amused as either
of the children. She never was cross or sad,
whatever happened.</p>

<p>“Of course Baby Morse has been here,”
said she; “nobody else would cut up such a
caper. But I haven’t seen her or heard a
sound of her all the morning.”</p>

<p>“I saw her,” said Jimmy. “She was playing
in the dirt with that horrid black thing;
but who’d ’a’ thought of her dropping it in
the churn?”</p>

<p>Then they had another hearty laugh, all
three of them; and Jimmy never dreamed that
he had been at all to blame. The cream was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the color of Mrs. Chick’s gray gown. She
poured it into a pan, to save it for the animals,
and then washed the churn.</p>

<p>“I won’t scold the boy; it was all my own
fault,” thought she. “It’s well I’m going to
take these children home to-day. If they
were to stay here much longer, I should let
’em pull the house down over my head.—Do
you hear what I say, Biddy Chick?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Dunlee was very much surprised that
afternoon to see Edy walk into the house
wrapped in an old shawl of Mrs. Chick’s, which
almost tripped her up at every step.</p>

<p>“O mamma!” she cried, throwing up her
arms, “my dress was just burnt off me!
The back of it, I mean.”</p>

<p>And while Mrs. Chick was trying to tell
the story, Edith began to laugh and cry wildly.</p>

<p>“O mamma!” said she, casting herself on
her mother’s neck, “you always did just
right with me; you knew best when you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
wouldn’t trust me with candles and things.
I <i>am</i> the careless-est girl!”</p>

<p>“There! I’m glad you’ve found it out,” retorted
Kyzie. “You never believed it when
anybody else said so.”</p>

<p>Mamma raised a warning finger, and Kyzie
was ashamed, and held her peace. She was
the dearest girl in the world, but liked to
lecture Edith; and Mrs. Dunlee thought Edith
did not need any lectures now. She was
feeling very humble.</p>

<p>“O mamma!” she went on, “I should think
you’d tie my feet and hands with a rope!
yes, I should! Too bad I burnt up Mrs.
Chick’s pretty rug! But then, oh, dear! just
think, you know, if there hadn’t been any
rug!”</p>

<p>To divert their minds, Mrs. Chick told the
story of Jimmy’s butter. They were much
amused; but the funniest part of it was to
hear her say,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>“But it was all my fault. I needn’t have
been so weak-minded.”</p>

<p>When she left next morning there was a roll
under the wagon-seat done up in brown paper.
She had not known that the roll was there till
she got home, when she found it contained a
beautiful rug—a far better one than had been
burned.</p>

<p>“Just like Mrs. Dunlee! She knew if I
should see it before I came away I should hate
to take it. And what’s this? A bran new
shawl! Well, well, well! She’s a good woman,
if there is one. Do you hear what I
say, Biddy Chick?”</p>

<h2>VII<br />

<small>THE BOY FROM NEW YORK</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> October a little boy came from New
York with his father to visit Major Irwin.
It was Gilly’s cousin, Dick Somers; and Dick
was destined to get Jimmy into trouble.</p>

<p>He was a boastful boy. He told wonderful
stories about the city of New York, where the
houses went as high as Jack’s beanstalk, and
the people had so much money that they almost
threw it away.</p>

<p>Dick had left a dog at home which seemed
to him now as large as a small burro. Yes, he
was sure of it. A dog much brighter than
Punch Dunlee, as well as vastly handsomer.</p>

<p>Dick had a beautiful sister; there was no
one like her in California. She had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
married six weeks before this in church; and
“I tell you what, they spread carpets all over
the streets for Maggie to walk on; yes, they
did!”</p>

<p>Gilbert only laughed at these remarkable
tales; but they annoyed Jamie, because they
made him feel so very inferior.</p>

<p>He tried in his turn to remember and relate
strange things that had happened to him or
that he had seen; but he did not succeed
very well. Dick despised rattlesnakes, horned
toads, gophers, and road-runners. He wouldn’t
believe there are quicksands in California,
where you can “slump down, down, clear out
of sight.”</p>

<p>“Pooh! you needn’t tell <i>me</i>!”</p>

<p>It was very discouraging to talk to Dick;
still Jimmy was always ready to talk.</p>

<p>One Saturday morning, Dick and Gilbert
came over to the Dunlees’ to play with Jimmy,
who was glad to see them. It was very still in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
and about the house that morning. Mr. Sanford
had been gone to the city of Washington
for many weeks, and it always seemed odd
without Mr. Sanford. To-day papa was visiting
a sick man just out of town; Mrs. Porter,
over the way, had borrowed the baby; Kyzie
and Edith were having a botany lesson with
Aunt Vi somewhere in a canyon; and Lucy
had gone to Lincoln Heights to spend the day.</p>

<p>“What a merry time the little boys seem
to be having in the stable!” remarked Mrs.
Dunlee to Vendla, as they heard the sound
of childish laughter floating in on the air.</p>

<p>She had asked Jimmy to get some hens’
eggs; for she and Vendla were to make some
cake for tea by a new recipe. There was no
haste about the eggs, however. Vendla stood
by the pantry window rolling out pie-crust with
a glass rolling-pin, and would not be ready to
begin upon the cake till her four pies had gone
into the oven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>Ah, that cake which had not been baked
yet, that cake by the new rule! If Mrs.
Dunlee and Vendla had only known what
strange thing would happen to it that afternoon
they certainly would not have made it at
all! But they did not know; and Mrs. Dunlee
very soon took down a large baking-pan and
buttered it, saying to herself all the while that
she hoped the baby was behaving well at Mrs.
Porter’s. She missed him, and missed her
three girls, and thought what a happy mother
she was with five such dear children. Yet,
after all, she was not sorry to have them out
of the house for once on a Saturday morning.</p>

<p>“There’s Jimmy laughing again, above the
other boys. He’s a noisy child; I wonder if
Baby Eddy will be as fond of fun as Jimmy?
Well, at any rate, I hope they’ll both grow
up to be good.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“‘And if they fall, or if they rise,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Be each, pray God, a gentleman.’”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Now it was time for the cake.</p>

<p>“Jimmy, Jimmy!” called Mrs. Dunlee from
the window. “You may bring the eggs now.”</p>

<p>All this while the little boys in the stable
had been chatting, and had hardly thought of
the eggs.</p>

<p>“Billy Dow thrashed me last night,” said
Gilbert, shaking his fist at the rafters. “But
I tell you I paid him off.”</p>

<p>“Paid him off, that big fellow?” said Jimmy.</p>

<p>“Of course! Did you s’pose Gilly was going
to forgive him?” cried the little cousin
from New York contemptuously. “Would you
forgive a boy that thrashed you, Jimmy Dunlee?”</p>

<p>“Ye-es,—if I couldn’t catch him! If he
was ever so much larger’n me!” was Jimmy’s
candid reply.</p>

<p>Gilly laughed. “<i>I</i> don’t forgive ’em ’cause
they’re big! If I didn’t dare hit Billy, I could
call him awful names, and run out my tongue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
at him; couldn’t I? Guess he won’t try to
thrash <i>me</i> again!”</p>

<p>“What did you call him?” asked Jimmy,
much interested.</p>

<p>“‘Billee! Billee!’ says I, as loud as I could
screech; ‘Billee, you’re an old monkey-wrench!’
says I.”</p>

<p>“Why!” exclaimed Jimmy, struck by Gilly’s
boldness. “Why-ee! I’ve had some o’ those
big boys call me a monkey; that’s bad
enough!”</p>

<p>“Yes; but I said monkey-wrench,” said
Gilly proudly.</p>

<p>“I was the one that told him the word!”
cried Dick, eager to share in the praise; “it’s
a word they have in New York.”</p>

<p>Not one of the three little boys thought
of asking, “What is a monkey-wrench?” It
sounded like something too bad to be talked
about.</p>

<p>“What’s that queer noise?” asked Dick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>It was John laughing all by himself in
the stall at what the boys were saying. But
when Jimmy peeped through the slats of the
stall at the pretty chocolate-and-white cow,
John stood there looking as solemn as an owl.</p>

<p>“We’ll get our eggs first, and then go in
and play with Jessie,” said Jimmy, thinking
this a great pleasure. But Dick, who had
hardly ever seen a cow, was secretly afraid
of Jessie’s “hooks.”</p>

<p>“Let’s see which’ll get the most eggs,”
said he, beginning to climb the ladder to the
mow.</p>

<p>And now began a hand-and-knee exploring-expedition
after eggs.</p>

<p>“Needn’t dig so deep,” said Jimmy, as Dick
thrust both arms up to the elbows in the
straw.</p>

<p>“Well, but I’ve found an egg, Jimmy Dunlee,
and you haven’t! Just as yellow! Do
you keep yellow hens?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>The laugh was now against Dick, who “didn’t
know everything,” so Gilly said, “even
if he did come from New York.”</p>

<p>“I’ve found two eggs,” said Gilly, “so, now,
what you think?”</p>

<p>“And I’ve found four,” cried Jimmy, trying
to pitch his voice on a subdued key. Too
much triumph might be impolite to his guests.</p>

<p>“Why, here are two more, makes four.
I found ’em myself,” said Gilbert grandly.
“What does your mamma do with so many
eggs?”</p>

<p>“She’s going to put these in a cake.”</p>

<p>“I like mince-pies better’n cake,” returned
Gilbert.</p>

<p>“I don’t eat ’em,” responded the boy from
New York disdainfully, “and my mamma’s
fankful I don’t!”</p>

<p>“What <i>do</i> you eat?” asked Jimmy.</p>

<p>Dick considered a moment.</p>

<p>“Apple-pie and cream candy and wedding-cake.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Sometimes I eat bread and butter—if
there’s jelly on it.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Jimmy with great respect, mingled
perhaps with a little envy.</p>

<p>Did this come of living “back East” in
New York? What more delightful than to
be Dick Somers, and live where you have
wedding-cake every day of your life!</p>

<p>“But,” ventured Jimmy with rising courage,
“maybe this will be wedding-cake that mamma’s
going to make. She didn’t say.”</p>

<p>The other boys laughed, and Dick said,—</p>

<p>“Pooh! I know better’n that! Say, none of
your sisters ever went and got married, did
they, Jim?”</p>

<p>Went and got married! His little sisters!
Jimmy pondered on this foolish question. Dick
meant it as an insult to his mamma’s cooking,
no doubt, though he could not see how. Making
sport of her cake, indeed, and before it
was baked!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Jimmy had tried to be polite to the boys
as his guests; but boys who go visiting ought
to be polite too.</p>

<p>“Dick Somers!” cried Jimmy in a towering
rage, “you stop that! I don’t care if you did
come from New York, you don’t know any
more about my mamma’s cake than you do
about—about horned toads, so there!”</p>

<p>It was just here that the pleasant voice
called from the pantry window,—</p>

<p>“Jimmy, Jimmy, you may bring the eggs
now.”</p>

<p>It was well that something should cut short
Jimmy’s angry speech. It was not safe to
discuss horned toads above all things with
Dick. Jimmy always grew furious to hear
Dick talk so wisely about them, when, as
Gilly said, “he wouldn’t know one from a
caterpillar;” whereas Jimmy had raised a whole
family of the queer little creatures, and knew
them like A B C.</p>

<h2>VIII<br />

<small>THE MISSING CAKE</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was pretty warm that Saturday afternoon,
but a strong southerly breeze was blowing.
Vendla had just set the last clean dishes on
the pantry shelf, and gone up-stairs, when her
mistress heard the sound of something falling,
and, going into the pantry, found that the
screen had fallen out of the window. Jimmy
stood just outside, talking with John, and the
screen had fallen close to Jimmy’s feet.</p>

<p>“Here, little one,” said John, “if you’ll
hand that up to me, I’ll pound it in so it
won’t come out. But what made you ask
about quicksands?”</p>

<p>“Oh, to tell Dick Somers! He won’t believe
a word I say.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s the little fellow from New York,
is it? Well, you tell him it’s all true. He
<i>can</i> sink up to his ears in a quicksand, and
he may try it if he wants to.”</p>

<p>“There! there! I knew it all the time,”
cried Jimmy. “I wish you’d tell him I did
see two live rattlesnakes, and I did see—oh,
lots of road-runners! He thinks I’m a pretty
nearly fool! Almost!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Dunlee heard this scrap of conversation
as Jimmy was entering the house. He
came along to the pantry, looking rather vexed
and discontented. His mother suspected he
was thinking of the New York boy, and wondered
a little that he should be so anxious
to go that very afternoon to return his visit.
Dick did not seem to be a very agreeable
companion, yet he had a sort of fascination
for Jimmy.</p>

<p>Jimmy-boy lingered about the pantry. The
frosted cake “made by a new rule” sat cooling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
on a platter, and the flies outside on the window-screen
were wildly longing to get in and
have a share; but the wire they beat against
was hard and strong, and would not let them
in.</p>

<p>Jimmy did not blame the flies for desiring
the cake. It was certainly beautiful to behold.
Could Dick Somers ever have seen anything
more spotlessly fair, even in the great
city of New York?</p>

<p>“Mamma, is this a wedding-cake?”</p>

<p>“No, dear; we only have wedding-cake when
people are married.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I forgot that! ’Course we don’t!”</p>

<p>Jimmy looked abashed. How could he have
been so stupid? He knew now why the boys
had laughed at him. Yes, and why Dick Somers
was always enjoying such an astonishing
amount of wedding-cake. Dick’s sister had
been married in church, and the whole city
had been carpeted for her to walk on, or so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Dick pretended. And naturally there had been
bushels and bushels of cake.</p>

<p>“When are you going to cut this, mamma?”</p>

<p>“To-night, my son.”</p>

<p>“Oh, goody! Wish I had a piece this minute
to carry to the boys! Dick Somers thinks
we don’t have anything good out here. Why,
mamma, he just makes fun of everything in
California!”</p>

<p>“You may give him a piece to-morrow,
Jamie.”</p>

<p>“May I?”</p>

<p>The little boy gazed wistfully at the cake.
He knew mamma had frosted it on purpose
to please her children; she and papa never
ate any frosting.</p>

<p>“It does look so smooth and nice before
it is cut up. If Dick could only see it all
whole!”</p>

<p>Jimmy seemed to be talking to himself,
rather than to his mother, and Mrs. Dunlee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
did not answer him. But she recalled the
remark afterwards, indeed that very evening,
after something had happened of which I am
about to tell you.</p>

<p>“I must go up-stairs now to change my
dress,” said she.</p>

<p>Jimmy followed her out of the pantry, and
she shut the door.</p>

<p>“Where are you going, my son?” asked
papa a little later, coming home from his
ride, and meeting Jimmy running off at full
speed.</p>

<p>“To Gilly Irwin’s, papa; mamma said I
might.”</p>

<p>Jimmy was in a hurry,—Mr. Dunlee observed
it,—in an unusual hurry. And, as
he rushed away like a whirlwind, he paused
an instant to pick up a basket which stood
under the large pepper-tree.</p>

<p>“I wonder what scheme the boy has in hand
now,” said Mr. Dunlee to himself. “There’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
not a man in town who carries on so much
business as our James.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Dunlee came down-stairs fresh and
smiling in her new cambric dress with lace
trimmings, and sat with her husband in the
shaded study. While she sewed, he read
aloud, or sometimes he dropped his book, and
they had a little chat.</p>

<p>It seemed very still, they both said. Not
a sound, even of Vendla stepping about the
kitchen, for Vendla was up-stairs sewing.</p>

<p>“How we do miss the children!” said Mrs.
Dunlee.</p>

<p>And they agreed that they missed the
“Prince Imperial,” as they called the baby,
more than any one of the others. He was
such a rollicking prince, never speaking a
single word, but ruling his loving subjects by
laughter and tears, and sometimes by a wave
of his royal hand.</p>

<p>At four o’clock he was brought home in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Mrs. Porter’s arms, beaming with joy; but refused
to tell where he had been, or who had
given him the string of pretty shells he wore
on his neck. He only smiled and cooed,
and mamma knelt at his feet, and said he
was “the sweetest baby ever was born.”</p>

<p>Then Lucy came home with two of her
cousins. She had visited a photographer with
Aunt Jessie, and a man had “tooken her picture.”</p>

<p>“He kissed his hand to me, papa, and then
he tooked it. But I don’t know where it is
now.”</p>

<p>“Did you keep still, little daughter?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, papa; I kept just as still! I was
very <i>gemplumly</i>.”</p>

<p>It had long been Lucy’s ambition to be
“gemplumly, just like Jimmy.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes the two older girls came
home. They brought a box full of wild-flowers,
and were rather flushed and tired and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
talkative. Very hungry too; for a “tramp
dog” had eaten most of their luncheon. Edy
was afraid if she didn’t have something to
eat in one minute, her head would fly into
pieces, it ached so hard.</p>

<p>“We can’t allow that,” said mamma. “Go
into the dining-room, every one of you! Draw
up your chairs to the table, and I’ll bring you
a plate of bread and butter.”</p>

<p>She went with a light step into the pantry;
but when she returned there was a cloud on
her face.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to think,” said she, setting
a plate of bread and the butter-dish on the
table. “I baked a loaf of cake this morning,
intending it for tea; but it is gone! Vendla!”
she called, going to the back staircase.</p>

<p>Vendla came down, looking rather serious.</p>

<p>“I went into the pantry half an hour ago,
ma’am,” said she, “and there was the empty
platter sitting on the shelf. And, thinks I,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
‘Where’s that cake? Mrs. Dunlee must have
put it in the cake-chest,’ But I looked in
the chest, and it wasn’t there. And that’s all
I know about it.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you come at once and tell me,
Vendla?”</p>

<p>The girl hesitated.</p>

<p>“I thought you might feel troubled about
it, ma’am. I was afraid you’d think”—</p>

<p>Mrs. Dunlee knew she would have said, “I
was afraid you’d think Master Jimmy took it.”</p>

<p>But Vendla could not speak the words, and
Mrs. Dunlee liked her all the better for it.</p>

<p>“My good girl,” said she, “did you go down-stairs
and lock the back door this afternoon
when I asked you to do so.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“And you saw no one about the house at
that time, Vendla?”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am. Master Jimmy had just gone
out. I heard his papa ask, ‘Where are you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
going?’ And Master Jimmy answered, ‘To
Gilly Irwin’s.’ That was just as I stood locking
the back door. And after that Mr. Dunlee
came into the front hall, and I heard him
hasp the screen door. I’m sure I did, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“And then you went up-stairs again, Vendla?
And you didn’t go into the pantry?”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am; I went straight up-stairs. I
was in a hurry to finish my blouse waist.”</p>

<p>“And you heard no one going or coming?”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am. Only once I heard John’s
step; he was looking after the cow.”</p>

<p>“That will do, Vendla; I don’t know what
to think about this!”</p>

<p>As Vendla left the dining-room, Kyzie looked
up quickly, exclaiming, “O mamma, don’t
look so! I can’t believe it was Jimmy!”</p>

<p>“Neither can I,” said Aunt Vi, forgetting
to eat her bread and butter.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem in the least like him,”
returned Mrs. Dunlee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>But she had grown quite pale, and was going
toward the study when her husband
entered the dining-room. He had overheard
part of the conversation, and looked as amazed
and distressed as his wife.</p>

<p>“Why, my dear,” said he, “it is incredible!”</p>

<p>“So it is, James. The boy is too old to do
such a thing; he has too much conscience.
But the question is, who took the cake?
It could not have gone without hands.”</p>

<p>“I see, I see, Prudy. And the doors were
all well fastened, and you and I sitting there
in the study.”</p>

<p>“And the house so still,” added Mrs. Dunlee.
“You know we spoke two or three times
of the stillness.”</p>

<p>Mr. Dunlee paced the floor in deep thought.</p>

<p>“There must be a way out of this,” he
said.</p>

<p>“The cat, you know,” suggested Edith.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Aunt Vi; “there’s always a cat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
to be suspected when there has been mischief.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid he put it in his basket,” went
on Mrs. Dunlee, referring of course to Jimmy,
and not the cat.</p>

<p>“He said he wanted some of the cake for
those boys, Gilly Irwin and his cousin; and
I told him he might have a piece to-morrow.
But he didn’t seem quite satisfied; I remember
it now distinctly. He said, ‘It does look so
smooth and nice before it is cut up. If Dick
could only see it all whole!’”</p>

<p>“What reply did you make?” asked Mr.
Dunlee.</p>

<p>“I believe I didn’t make any reply. Do
you suppose, now, Jimmy could have thought
I meant to give him the cake?”</p>

<p>“Hardly likely,” said Mr. Dunlee. “But
there is one possibility I can think of. He
may have taken it to show to the boys, intending
to bring it back uncut and uninjured.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
I know he had a basket in his hand; that
large one he carries.”</p>

<p>“Did he really have that basket?” returned
Mrs. Dunlee. “Then it does look
very much as if he put the cake in it!
Hush! isn’t that Jimmy’s step in the hall?”</p>

<h2>IX<br />

<small>THE INDIAN BASKET</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy-boy</span> came in swinging his basket on
his arm. It was a remarkably pretty Indian
basket; and ever since Aunt Vi had given it
to him two weeks ago, it had travelled with
him wherever he went.</p>

<p>“Jimmy,” said his mother as the little feet
reached the threshold, “Jimmy, I would like
to see you in the study.”</p>

<p>The tone was grave; the boy looked up in
alarm. Mamma was sure to be “in earnest”
when she spoke like this, and wished to see
him in the study.</p>

<p>The moment they entered the study she
closed the door and turned and looked at him.
What was she going to say?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>“Jamie, O Jamie! did you carry it off in
the basket?”</p>

<p>“Carry what off, mamma?”</p>

<p>“He speaks very innocently, as if it were
quite new to him,” thought his mother.</p>

<p>She took the basket from his hand, and
measured it with her eye. Yes, it was large
enough; it could easily have held the whole
loaf. But it was empty now. If Jimmy had
carried off the loaf to show to the boys, he
had not brought it back.</p>

<p>“My son, where is the cake I baked and
frosted this morning?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know! Why, mamma, you didn’t
s’pose <i>I</i> took that cake?”</p>

<p>There was a quiver of pain in the young
voice. Mrs. Dunlee looked at her child
eagerly, as if she would read his very soul.</p>

<p>“Did you take it, Jamie? You said you
wanted to show it to Dick Somers; you wished
him to see it before it was cut. Now the
cake is gone. Did you take it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>The tone was very gentle, but it moved
Jimmy strangely. He hung his head and
burst into tears. Was he sorry he had been
found out? Or did it grieve him to be suspected
wrongfully?</p>

<p>“No, mamma,” said he; “I never did it.”</p>

<p>“Jimmy, I want the truth! Remember your
dear Heavenly Father hears what you say.”</p>

<p>Jimmy only sobbed the harder at this.</p>

<p>“If you took the cake, and are sorry for
it, I will forgive you.”</p>

<p>“O mamma! did you think I took it?”</p>

<p>“I hope not, my dear. Only we don’t know
what has become of it. And you said you
wanted Dick Somers to see that we have nice
things in California.”</p>

<p>Jimmy writhed in strong excitement.</p>

<p>“Yes, mamma, he’s just the meanest boy!
I wish I could tell you how mean he is.
When I carried him the”—</p>

<p>Jimmy paused suddenly. There was silence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
for half a minute while he struggled with himself.
It seemed as if he were almost on the
point of confession, and something held him
back. Was it so? His mother could not
be sure, for he would not let her see his
face.</p>

<p>“So you carried something to Dick? What
was it, Jamie?”</p>

<p>“O mamma, mamma! don’t ask me. I can’t
tell. He was so mean about it, mamma!”</p>

<p>About the cake? Mrs. Dunlee wondered.
Had Dick teased the little boy by finding
fault with it? If so, Jimmy would not like
to tell her. A word against his mother,
or against anything his mother did, was always
very hard for Jimmy to bear.</p>

<p>“What did Dick say or do that was mean,
my son? Do not be afraid to tell mamma.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t tell you what he said!”</p>

<p>Jimmy had not looked up at all, and now
he hid his face in his hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>“If he was innocent, why should he do so?
Why shouldn’t he look at me?” thought Mrs.
Dunlee, her heart aching with grief and pity.</p>

<p>But it was useless urging him. At any allusion
to the cake he exclaimed,—</p>

<p>“No, mamma, I never.”</p>

<p>As if, having once said the words, he was
determined to go on repeating them over and
over. There had always been a strain of obstinacy
in Jimmy’s character, as his mother
was well aware. She turned sorrowfully away,
and left the little boy alone in the study, his
face buried deep in his father’s easy-chair.</p>

<p>It was a sad evening for everybody. Even
the Prince Imperial ceased to enjoy his string
of shells, and became too low-spirited to
smile. No one but Kyzie had much hope of
Jimmy’s innocence; but Kyzie said,—</p>

<p>“It wasn’t one bit like Jimmy-boy to take
the cake in the first place. And then he
never would lie about it! Mamma, do think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
again; couldn’t a thief have slipped into the
house ever so softly by the back door?</p>

<p>“It only makes you sigh, mamma; you think
it’s so absurd. I know it’s absurd. Somebody
took that cake off the shelf, and left the
platter, and it seems as if it must be Jimmy.
Still, I can’t believe ’twas Jimmy. I almost
think ’twas somebody that dropped down
through the ‘sky-hole.’”</p>

<p>She meant the window in the roof. Lucy
called it the sky-hole.</p>

<p>Mr. Dunlee turned as he was pacing the
floor.</p>

<p>“I am almost as unreasonable as Katharine,”
said he; “I can’t give it up that Jamie
is guilty. I must have a little talk with him
myself before I am convinced.”</p>

<p>He went into the study. The poor boy was
still crying bitterly. Mr. Dunlee seated himself
in the big chair, and took him in his
arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>“Perhaps you thought mamma meant to
give you the cake? Was that what you
thought? To divide with your little friends?”</p>

<p>Jimmy could not answer.</p>

<p>“If so, that was only a mistake. Perhaps you
carried it away, and cut it up in big pieces
for the boys? Tell papa all about it.”</p>

<p>“O papa! I can’t tell; but I never touched
the cake.”</p>

<p>“Then what did you carry off in your basket?”</p>

<p>“O papa! please don’t ask me,” wailed
Jimmy. “’Twas something—something I
can’t talk about! I promised not to.”</p>

<p>“My son, this grows more and more mysterious.
I can’t urge you to break a promise,
though why you should have made one I can’t
possibly see. If you promised not to tell about
the cake, that was wrong, and”—</p>

<p>Jamie raised his head earnestly. “O papa!
don’t you believe me when I speak?”</p>

<p>“My precious child, I do so long to believe
you!”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 437px;">
<img src="images/i125.jpg" width="437" height="600" alt="Mother looking down at Jimmy" />
<div class="caption">“Jamie, O, Jamie, did you carry it off?”<br />

<div class="attrib"><i><a href="#Page_114">Page 114.</a></i></div></div>
</div>

<p>Jimmy slipped down from his father’s knee,
and stood upright before him, his eyes shining
with a new thought.</p>

<p>“Does God know everything, papa?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, my child.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, when you go to heaven, papa,
you just ask God if I haven’t told you the
truth,” said Jimmy; and broke down again,
and shook with sobs.</p>

<p>Mr. Dunlee caught the little pleader in his
arms. He knew no more than before what
had become of the cake, but he was sure from
that moment that Jimmy had not taken it.</p>

<p>“If he had, he never would have dared
make a speech like that,” said the minister to
his wife as he came out of the study, looking
much happier than when he had gone
in.</p>

<p>“I hope you are right; I believe you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a><br /><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
right,” replied Mrs. Dunlee, her eyes brimming
with tears. “Still, we must wait a while to
make sure.”</p>

<p>The next day, Sunday, was not a happy one.
The older children knew the exceeding sinfulness
of a lie, and it was certain that Jimmy
knew it also. Yet what had become of the
cake?</p>

<p>“Jimmy, what’s the matter o’ you?” asked
wee Lucy, going up to her brother, and putting
her little arms around his neck.</p>

<p>“Oh, they just despise me as hard as anything!”
he replied.</p>

<p>It broke his heart to be “despised.” He
did not know how everybody pitied and longed
to help him, or he would not have been so
unhappy.</p>

<p>Just before dinner Kyzie happened to go
into the pantry. As she was returning to
the kitchen she heard a noise at the pantry
window, like the rattling of dishes, and, looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
that way, saw Jessie, the pretty cow, eating
a custard-pie.</p>

<p>The pie was sitting on the window-ledge,
within easy reach, and Jessie was helping herself
without fork or spoon.</p>

<p>“Come, mamma! come quick!” cried Kyzie.</p>

<p>Mamma came; and Jessie stood still, and
finished the pie before her eyes, licking the
plate too, as though she would not miss a
morsel.</p>

<p>“Did you ever see such impudence?” said
Kyzie, laughing.</p>

<p>But mamma was not listening.</p>

<p>“Jessie ate that cake!” she exclaimed.
“Where is John?”</p>

<p>John was surprised to see every one so
excited.</p>

<p>“I let the cow out into the back yard yesterday
about two minutes,” said he; “but
I never thought of her cutting up a caper
in the pantry! When I went after her, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
was standing close to the pantry window, to
be sure, and the screen was out. I put it
back; and thinks I, ‘That’s the second time
I’ve done it to-day. I’ll fix that screen Monday
so it will act better.’”</p>

<p>“Did you see Jessie eating the cake?”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am; she must have swallowed it
pretty spry, for I never saw a crumb of
it.”</p>

<p>“O Jessie, Jessie! we never knew you
were a thief!” said Edith, hugging the pretty
animal whose “sweet tooth” had caused all
this trouble.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dunlee had no time or thought for the
cow. She was watching the happy smiles on
Jimmy’s face.</p>

<p>“My precious, innocent boy!” said she,
holding him close, as if she could never let
him go.</p>

<p>“You made a mistake when you said the
cake couldn’t have gone without hands; didn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
you, mamma?” said Kyzie, trying to laugh;
but somehow the tears would come first.</p>

<p>“Mamma,” whispered Jimmy-boy,—and a
lighter-hearted boy you never saw,—“mamma,
put your ear down close; I want to say something.
I knew all the time I didn’t do it, and
I knew God knew I didn’t do it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear; that is so.”</p>

<p>“And I knew God would tell you and
papa all about it when you got to heaven,
mamma; but, oh, I didn’t want to wait!”</p>

<p>“No, you dear, suffering child,” replied his
mother. “And, thank God, we didn’t any of
us have to wait! We’re so glad to know it
all now!”</p>

<p>And then she kissed Jimmy on his mouth
and hair and eyes; and the children all gathered
around, and Kyzie said,—</p>

<p>“Isn’t this a beautiful Sunday? I’d rather
have it than a diamond ring.”</p>

<p>It was not till Tuesday that they learned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
what Jimmy had carried off in the basket;
and then Mr. Somers, Dick’s father, told it,
laughing, to Mr. Dunlee. It was horned
toads.</p>

<p>Little Dick had declared that they had eyes
in the backs of their heads. Jimmy and Gilbert
disputed this, and told him to look for
himself.</p>

<p>“I won’t look,” said Dick. “Guess I
<i>know</i>! I’ll leave it to my <i>papa</i> if I don’t
know!”</p>

<p>The more he was laughed at, the more he
insisted, saying at last,—</p>

<p>“I’ll give you five cents, Jimmy Dunlee,
for every toad you’ll find that <i>hasn’t</i> got
eyes back of his head! Bring ’em along,
sir, and let my papa see ’em, and I’ll give
you fi—ive cents apiece!”</p>

<p>So Jimmy, expecting to make a small
fortune, had roamed far and wide, and collected
five toads; for he could not spare his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
tame ones. But when he took them to
Major Irwin’s, Dick only said,—</p>

<p>“What you s’pose <i>I</i> want o’ those toads?”</p>

<p>Jimmy was angry.</p>

<p>“You <i>told</i> me to bring ’em! Look at ’em
now; look this minute! You <i>said</i> they had
eyes back o’ their heads!”</p>

<p>Dick was laughed at by the whole family,
and made to confess that these were the
first horned toads he had ever seen. His
father called him “a little braggart;” and
for once in his life the boy was ashamed,
and ran crying down cellar to hide.</p>

<p>Jimmy threw back his shoulders proudly.
It was a great triumph to have humbled
Dick Somers! And then, besides that, to
have earned twenty-five cents!</p>

<p>But when he modestly asked for his
money, what did those people all do but fall
to laughing again?</p>

<p>And the wider his honest brown eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
opened with surprise, the harder they all
laughed!</p>

<p>Jimmy could not see anything funny in the
affair; he only saw that he had been cheated
and imposed upon. As he turned indignantly
on his heel, Hatty Irwin, Gilbert’s sister, said
in a low tone,—</p>

<p>“The little toad-merchant is going home
to see if his mamma will buy his toads.”</p>

<p>Hatty did not expect to be overheard; but
Jimmy caught the words, and was cut to the
heart. He shouted wildly,—</p>

<p>“I shall <i>not</i> tell my mamma! I shall <i>not</i>
tell any single body at my house, so there!”</p>

<p>And all the while he was running away
from these cruel people as fast as he could
go.</p>

<p>If he had not made this sudden, impulsive
promise to Hatty, all might have been different.
For then he would have related his
woes to his own family; mamma would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
pitied and soothed him; and, better than all,
there would have been no mystery as to what
was carried off in the basket.</p>

<p>Instead of that,—but you know the story,
and can fancy how poor Jimmy-boy suffered.</p>

<p>Dick Somers went home that very week;
and Mrs. Dunlee said to her husband,—</p>

<p>“I am really glad for Jimmy’s sake. I am
sure Jimmy has not been made very happy
by the little boy from New York.”</p>

<h2>X<br />

<small>A GREAT SECRET</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">People</span> were beginning to think and talk
about Christmas. There was a pleasant stir in
the air of something mysterious and delightful
about to happen. Mamma and Aunt Vi
were often together in Aunt Vi’s “snuggery”
up-stairs, and what they were consulting about
nobody ventured to ask; some uncommonly
fine present for each of the children, no
doubt.</p>

<p>One day Aunt Vi, who was sewing in the
back parlor, looked up from her work, and
said,—</p>

<p>“Jimmy-boy, do you think you could go to
the store and buy me some blue sewing-silk
like this pattern?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>And she held up a bit of blue satin.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you ask <i>me</i>, Auntie?” exclaimed
Edith, dropping the doll she was
dressing in a new tea-gown. “Boys don’t
know the difference between a skein of silk
and a clothes-line.”</p>

<p>Aunt Vi secretly thought that she could
trust Jimmy better than Edith, but she did
not like to say so.</p>

<p>“Then you may get me the silk, if you will,
Edith; two spools.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll go with you,” said Jimmy-boy.</p>

<p>“If you’re going, I’ll have to go too,”
piped wee Lucy.</p>

<p>“Of course,” thought Edith. “And there’s
the dog, <i>he’ll</i> have to follow,—the ‘inevitable
dog,’ Aunt Vi calls him. Oh, dear!”</p>

<p>“If the whole family is to go, we may as
well have more errands done!” exclaimed
mamma with a playful smile. “Can I trust
you, Edith, to call at our grocer’s, Mr. Ladd’s,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
and ask him to send me two pounds of Santa
Isabel butter?”</p>

<p>“‘Can I trust you?’” repeated Edith to herself.
“Why do people always say that to me,
as if they didn’t feel <i>sure</i>?”</p>

<p>“Yes, mamma,” she added aloud; “two
pounds blue silk, two spools San Isabel’s
butter;” then corrected her own mistake,
laughing.</p>

<p>The little party went skipping along in a
very gay mood, the “inevitable dog” at their
heels. Instead of proceeding at once to the
stores, Edith chose to go two or three blocks
out of the way, to watch a couple of tiny
boys riding together on the back of a burro,
and to see how fast the workmen were getting
on in building a tall house she greatly
admired.</p>

<p>They passed Mrs. Phillips’s brown cottage,
with the bird-of-paradise flowers in the garden.
Edith had a fancy for these gay, graceful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
flowers, with their very long scarlet
streamers floating on the air like little banners.
But just now she should not have
gone that way; it was one of her mistakes.
Her mother had said to her only the day
before,—</p>

<p>“Edith, when you are out with Lucy, I would
prefer you shouldn’t go near Mrs. Phillips’s
house, for I don’t like to expose Lucy to
whooping-cough.”</p>

<p>Edith would not have “exposed” her little
sister on any account if she had only stopped
to think. She believed whooping-cough to be almost
sure death. Hadn’t she had it herself just
before Jimmy was born, and nearly died of it?
So she firmly believed. At any rate, the
nurse, Mrs. Chick, had not allowed her to
go near the new baby,—only think of that!
She had had to look at Jimmy through the
window! She was only two years old at the
time, and could not remember anything about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
it, but this was what everybody said. It had
always impressed Edith as something very
strange and dreadful, that she had been shut
away like that from her own baby Jimmy!
And, after all, he had had whooping-cough
just the same.</p>

<p>“Why, there’s Sadie Phillips at the window!”
said Jimmy. “What makes her face
so red?”</p>

<p>Then all in a moment Edith stopped short
in the street, and recalled her mother’s warning.
She had done the wickedest, dreadfullest
thing in the world to take Lucy near that
cottage! And alas, alas! Sadie Phillips was
coughing; that was what made her face look
so red. The window was closed, it is true;
but Edith heard the frightful sound, and it
fell on her heart like a knell.</p>

<p>“What made me come here? What shall
I do?” she wailed, seizing her little sister
in her arms, and running furiously down the
street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>Wee Lucy screamed, the dog barked, and
Jimmy cried out, “What is it? What is it?”
not knowing what to make of this strange
behavior.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve <i>esposed</i> Lucy! I’ve esposed
Lucy!” cried wretched Edith, the tears raining
down her cheeks.</p>

<p>Lucy struggled out of her arms, laughing.
She did not know what “esposed” meant;
neither did Jimmy; and it may be that Edith
did not clearly know herself.</p>

<p>“O Lucy darling, don’t laugh; it’s dreadful;
it’s awful! What does make you act so,
Jimmy? We must run, run, run! Lucy’s
going to have whooping-cough, sure as you
live.”</p>

<p>Upon that the small sister very naturally
felt a tickling in the windpipe, and rasped
her throat, trying to see if a cough would
come. Nothing could so have increased
Edith’s fright.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>The better Lucy succeeded in coughing, the
harder Edith cried, and the louder barked the
wondering dog.</p>

<p>This delighted roguish Lucy. She liked to
have Edith cry over her; it made her feel
very important. She wished Jimmy would cry
too; but he only said coolly,—</p>

<p>“Hush, Lucy; you haven’t got it; you
needn’t <i>pertend</i>.”</p>

<p>“I know she hasn’t got it yet,” replied
Edith; “it takes a long while. But what I’m
crying about is, she’s going to get it! She’s
swallowed some; she swallowed it when we
stood by Sadie’s house.”</p>

<p>It was of no use for Jimmy to say “Pooh!”
This was a matter of life and death to Edith.
She wanted to take Lucy home at once, and
perhaps have her shut in a dark room, or at
any rate put to bed.</p>

<p>But those errands!</p>

<p>“Jimmy,” said she, as they came in sight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
of the stores, “my eyes don’t look very red,
do they?”</p>

<p>Truthful James had to reply,—</p>

<p>“Yes, they do,—red as a lobster cactus.”</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t help it. You stay out here
with Punch and Lucy, while I go in for the
silk.”</p>

<p>“See here! I’ve thought of something,”
said Jimmy, touched by Edith’s distress. “If
Lucy did swallow some, can’t they give her
something to cure it? Mamma could, I guess,
or Dr. Devoll.”</p>

<p>“Why, I never thought of that,” returned
Edith, gathering courage.</p>

<p>“Now, Lucy, you <i>will</i> be willing to take a
pill when we get home if mamma thinks it’s
best?”</p>

<p>Lucy wasn’t quite sure. She thought it
would depend somewhat upon the size of the
pill, also upon the sort of jelly it was offered
in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, how she does act sometimes!” sighed
Edith. “Now, Lucy, you stay out here with
the dog and Jimmy; you stay out here till I
come back.”</p>

<p>Lucy consented.</p>

<p>It was a red-eyed, broken-hearted little girl
who entered Mr. Hall’s store and asked for blue
sewing-silk. You would hardly have known
her for happy Edith Dunlee.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, sir,” she said when a spool was
offered her. “Not silk; <i>thread</i>. She wants
to <i>sew</i> it!” The salesman looked surprised,
then amused, then sorry; for by this time Edith
had begun to cry again.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it be well, little miss, for you
to go home now, and come back again when
you know your errand.”</p>

<p>Edith had to confess that it would.</p>

<p>She went next to the grocer’s for butter.</p>

<p>“I will send it up,” said the clerk.</p>

<p>But no, Edith was sure mamma had intended
that she should carry it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>It was given her in a paper bag, and she
held the bag close to her heart, and cried
over it; and by the time they reached home
the butter was ready to melt. She dropped
it in a chair, and shrieked out,—</p>

<p>“O mamma, Lucy’s been there! I took
her! I <i>s’posed</i> her!”</p>

<p>And down Edith sank upon the sofa in
unspeakable woe. Little Lucy finished the
direful story.</p>

<p>“Hookin’-cock, mamma, hookin’-cock! Give
me a pill! Please put it in squinch jelly!”</p>

<p>I must confess that mamma and Aunt Vi
fell to laughing in the most unfeeling manner.
Each tried in turn to soothe poor Edith;
and mamma said that even if Mrs. Phillips’s
window had been wide open,—and Jimmy was
sure it was shut,—that even with the window
open it was hardly probable that Lucy
had been exposed in so short a time.</p>

<p>“And whooping-cough is nothing very serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
here in California, my daughter. Children
suffer very little from it in this mild
climate. I wouldn’t mind Lucy’s having it
some time, say next spring; but just now,”—</p>

<p>Here she looked at Aunt Vi, who blushed
and smiled.</p>

<p>“It <i>would</i> be rather awkward just now,”
said Aunt Vi.</p>

<p>“Yes,” returned Mrs. Dunlee; “we mustn’t
have any whooping-cough in the house till
after the wedding.”</p>

<p>“Wedding?” repeated Edith, “what wedding?”</p>

<p>“Am I not a stupid woman!” exclaimed
mamma, putting her hand over her mouth.
“I came very near letting out a great secret.”</p>

<p>“But is there going to be a wedding,
mamma?”</p>

<p>Edith’s tears were dried now. She had
thrown to the winds all her whooping-cough
fright.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is there going to be a wedding, mamma?”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear, sometime and somewhere we
hope there will be a wedding. It isn’t quite
time yet to talk much about it. Very soon
you will know.”</p>

<p>Edith looked from her mother to her aunt,
her eyes full of questions. But before she
had time to put the questions into words,
Aunt Vi inquired about her blue sewing-silk.
Too bad to have to stop and explain
all that; for afterwards Edith couldn’t find
out the least thing about the wedding,—whose
it was, or where or when. Papa pretended
that it was very likely some Indians
from Arizona.</p>

<p>“O papa! now you know it’s not Indians!
And it’s nobody in Arizona either. The wedding
belongs right here in California.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! And possibly in this very house.
Who knows?”</p>

<p>Edith felt that she was being trifled with.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
Who was there in this house to be married
but papa and mamma?</p>

<p>And they had been married already.</p>

<p>Then one day somebody said Mr. Henry
Sanford was coming home from Washington.</p>

<p>“Oh, now I know!” cried Edith. “It’s Mr.
Sanford and Aunt Vi; it’s Mr. Sanford and
Aunt Vi!”</p>

<p>She was right. They were to be married
at Christmas, just two weeks ahead.</p>

<p>“If Lucy doesn’t have whooping-cough, you
mean?” said Edith. “If she does, I s’pose
you’ll have to put off the wedding?”</p>

<p>No one answered this question. No one
knew how it weighed upon Edith and Jimmy,
or how closely they watched their little sister,
fearing she might suddenly fall to coughing,
and put a stop to the whole delightful and
extraordinary plans for Christmas.</p>

<p>But Lucy did not cough,—except when
somebody reminded her.</p>

<h2>XI<br />

<small>A WEE WEDDING</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Christmas</span> was almost here. One morning
Mrs. Dunlee went about the house singing,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The shepherds heard it overhead;</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The joyful angels raised it then;</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">’Glory to God on high!’ it said,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">‘And peace on earth to gentle <i>men</i>.’”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“That’s <i>me</i>,” thought Jimmy. He felt that
he had a private and particular claim on
Christmas, for it was his birthday. Now
birthdays were becoming an old story to
Jimmy. He had had quantities of them,
and this would be the sixth; but a wedding
was something new. “<i>What was a wedding?</i>”</p>

<p>Sometimes people came to the house to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
married, and papa married them in the parlor,
the children not being allowed to go in.
But that “didn’t count;” what was a <i>wedding</i>?</p>

<p>“Where’ll they put it?” asked wee Lucy.</p>

<p>“It isn’t a thing you can put anywhere; it
isn’t a vase or a teapot,” replied Edith. “It’s
only something that folks <i>do</i>. Aunt Vi is
going to marry Mr. Sanford,—no, he’s going
to marry Aunt Vi.”</p>

<p>This did not help the matter much.</p>

<p>“What do they do it for?” asked Jimmy.</p>

<p>Edith herself was perplexed as to that, though
she did not like to own it.</p>

<p>“Oh, mamma says Mr. Sanford is coming
here because papa is a <i>minister</i>!” She spoke
proudly, as if the world held but one. “Papa
is a minister, and can do it just right. ’Twill
be a great deal worse than Thanksgiving and
Christmas. A monstrous cake, black as a
shoe,—Kyzie didn’t mean I should know about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
that,—and chicken salad, and lobster salad,
and I <i>think</i> turkey salad. Ice-cream, I know;
ice-cream,—ever so many colors, just like a
bed of flowers. And—and—well, I can’t remember
the rest.”</p>

<p>Jimmy’s eyes grew very brilliant. The
mention of black cake, and cream all the
colors of the rainbow, had placed the wedding
in a much clearer light. He went and reported
to wee Lucy, and Lucy mounted a
chair and told the looking-glass.</p>

<p>“Auntie’s going to be mallied! Papa’ll be
there in his pulpit right in the parlor. Roses
and i-scream; worse’n Kismus, worse’n birf-days!”</p>

<p>“Cheer, boys, cheer!” added Jimmy, by way
of chorus.</p>

<p>The night but one before the wedding he
and Lucy were strangely wide awake. Lucy
lay in her crib at least five minutes with open
eyes, wondering why <i>she</i> couldn’t be married<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
as well as Aunt Vi. She meant to ask
mamma. When Jamie fell asleep it was to
dream of weddings. The weddings seemed
to be made chiefly of white and pink sugar,
and danced a ring-round-rosy with papa in
the middle, papa taking up a deal of room
on account of his pulpit.</p>

<p>There was one thing very remarkable indeed
which Edith had not told Jimmy, simply
because she did not know it herself. He
learned it next day from dear Aunt Vi. It
was this:—</p>

<p>Jimmy was to be groomsman at the wedding,
and Lucy was to be bridesmaid! Somebody
had been making a beautiful white frock
for little Lucy, all embroidered with silk apple-blossoms.
Some one else had been making
a charming blue suit for Jimmy, all spangled
with silver.</p>

<p>Why shouldn’t these two children go nearly
wild with rapture? Why shouldn’t they think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the wedding was made on purpose for themselves,
and that Aunt Vi had little to do with
it, except to look on and admire their new
clothes?</p>

<p>Auntie had lived in the house ever since
they could remember. They loved her dearly,
and it was very sad that Mr. Sanford should
have taken this sudden notion to come and
carry her off to Washington.</p>

<p>“She’ll never, never see any more cherry-trees,”
thought Lucy. “Georgie has cut ’em
all down!”</p>

<p>But they had little time to grieve over losing
their aunt, little time to pity her for
being obliged to go away; their new clothes
filled all their thoughts. Jimmy felt that life
had nothing grander to offer him than the
honor of being “best man” at a wedding.
It was as if he was about to become a king,
and wear a royal crown.</p>

<p>As for Lucy, she was in such a flutter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
delight, that Kyzie had to watch her, lest she
should run all over town to say to people,—
“What you fink? I’se going to be mallied
to Aunt Vi.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sanford arrived from Washington the
very day before Christmas. Lucky for him
that he was in season for the wedding!</p>

<p>“May I tell him about it, mamma?” asked
Lucy.</p>

<p>Mamma thought it would do no harm.</p>

<p>“There’s going to be <i>sumfin’</i> at my house
to-morrow, Mr. Sanford, worse’n <i>you</i> ever saw!
And Jimmy and I are going to stand up in
it. It’s a wedding! <i>Wasn’t</i> you glad you
came?”</p>

<p>“Very glad! I wouldn’t have missed it for
anything. A wedding, do you say, Miss Snippet?
Pray, who is the bride?”</p>

<p>And he looked solemnly at Aunt Vi, whose
cheeks were the color of the buds on Lucy’s
rosebush.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>Lucy could not answer. She did not ’member
that she had heard anyfing about a
bride.</p>

<p>Jimmy, who was kneeling before Mr. Sanford,
had never heard of a bride.</p>

<p>“I’m groomsman, you know,” said he,
hoping he did not look as proud as he felt.
“I’m groomsman, and Lucy is bridesmaid.
We’ve got some <i>splendid</i> clothes! But I
don’t believe there’ll be any bride. Mamma
never said anything about that.”</p>

<p>“Ah! But, Jimmy, if I were you I would
look around sharply, and try to find a bride.
Brides are all the fashion nowadays at weddings.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Jimmy coldly. He never
troubled his head about fashions. It struck
him, too, that the Dunlees ought to be able
to manage their own wedding, without the
help of Mr. Sanford, a man who did not belong
in the family. Still, being a boy of good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
manners, Jimmy refrained from speaking all
his thoughts; he merely said, “Oh!”</p>

<p>Christmas dawned at last, birthday, wedding,
and all. The house was full of presents; not
for the children, though. <i>They</i> had very few
this year. And in the evening people began
to call. Whether the presents and the people
made any part of the wedding Jimmy and
Lucy could not fairly make out. Nothing
more was heard of a bride.</p>

<p>The children had been dressed quite early,
and afterwards kept up-stairs so long that
they began to grow tired. By and by somebody
gave each of them a very large bouquet
and said, “Come.”</p>

<p>They heard music, and, keeping step to it,
marched gayly down-stairs. The parlor was
full of people, all richly dressed, but none of
them so fine as the little groomsman and
bridesmaid—oh, by no means!—or half so
well pleased with their clothes! Aunt Vi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
and Mr. Sanford were going into the parlor
too.</p>

<p>Nobody spoke; that sweet music was playing.
Mamma whispered to Jimmy to take
Lucy’s hand; and the two children went up
to join Aunt Vi and Mr. Sanford in the
bay-window. Lucy stood beside Aunt Vi, and
Jimmy-boy beside Mr. Sanford, as had been
agreed upon beforehand.</p>

<p>All heads were turned that way. The
little groomsman and bridesmaid felt that the
proud moment had come when they were to
be seen and admired by the whole world.
Lucy felt Aunt Vi tremble, and wondered
why she should be so frightened. Or was
she only cold? Lucy stole a quick glance at
her face. Why, how pale it looked! the pretty
pink color all gone out of her cheeks! Her
dress was soft, cream-colored silk, with only
lace on it, not half so sweet as the apple-blossoms
on Lucy’s.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 512px;">

<div class="caption">“The little groomsman and bridesmaid.”<br />

<div class="attrib"><i><a href="#Page_150">Page 150.</a></i></div></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>Lucy did not speak. She had promised
she wouldn’t; and besides, there was no
chance for anybody to speak. Papa was
standing there, just going to preach, though,
to be sure, he had no pulpit. It wasn’t
much of a sermon, either. He only asked
some questions, and Aunt Vi and Mr. Sanford
answered so low you could hardly hear.
Then there was a ring put on Aunt Vi’s
finger, and papa talked some more, and prayed
a little.</p>

<p>Lucy drew a long breath, but kept perfectly
quiet. Jimmy was quiet too, though
they both looked sober and surprised. <i>This</i>
was not funny in the least, not at all what
they had expected. There was no “ring-round-rosy,”
or “button, button,” or dancing, or
<i>anything</i> nice. And this was what they called
a wedding!</p>

<p>But it was over before very long, and then
the people began to stir again. There was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
a buzz of pleasant talking all through the
room. People here and there laughed softly;
but mamma and one or two other ladies put
their handkerchiefs to their eyes. It couldn’t
be that they were crying? How strange!
how very strange! Grown-up ladies crying at
a party!</p>

<p>And people were coming up to kiss Aunt
Vi, and shake hands with Mr. Sanford. What
was that for? If they had only kissed Jimmy
and Lucy, and said how spl-en-didly they
looked, and how well they had behaved, there
might have been some sense in it.</p>

<p>Jimmy’s lip curled a little.</p>

<p>And who was <i>Mrs. Sanford</i>? Again and
again people went up to Aunt Vi, and said,
“My dear Mrs. Sanford,” which of course
wasn’t her name.</p>

<p>Then everybody went out to the dining-room.
But think of setting a noble groomsman
like Jimmy, and a fair bridesmaid like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Lucy, off in a corner, and telling them to
“stay there and not speak yet”!</p>

<p>And before anybody had a chance to eat
much, something else happened. Jimmy heard
wheels, and, peeping through the window, saw
that a carriage had been driven up the gravel
path,—a carriage with blue velvet cushions
and two handsome chestnut horses.</p>

<p>There it stood and stood. Nobody knew it
was there but Jimmy.</p>

<p>And presently Aunt Vi went off in this
carriage, and Mr. Sanford went with her.
The oddest thing! Right away from the
company! So impolite!</p>

<p>Mamma was crying just a little in the hall
before they started. Auntie had on a different
dress and a new bonnet. She held the
children close, and dropped a tear on Lucy’s
cheek. Poor, poor auntie! how she did hate
to go! But Mr. Sanford hurried her into the
carriage, which rolled away; and then mamma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
and papa went back to the dining-room, and
went on eating chicken-salad.</p>

<p>Up to this time, during all the topsy-turvy
proceedings, people had seemed very cold-hearted,
or very forgetful; but now they
began to take notice of Jimmy and Lucy.
They said they were the sweetest groomsman
and bridesmaid ever seen, as lovely as fairies;
and gave them more kisses twice over than
had been given Aunt Vi.</p>

<p>“I dare say this is the first wedding you
ever saw, my love?” asked one of the ladies
of Lucy.</p>

<p>Lucy turned uncertainly to her mother.
“Mamma, did Jimmy and I ever mally anybody
before?”</p>

<p>“No, dear.”</p>

<p>The children were eating ice-cream now,
their hearts growing every moment happier and
lighter. Still the chief event of the evening
remained a dark mystery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>“What made Aunt Vi go off with Mr. Sanford?”
asked the bewildered Jimmy.</p>

<p>Papa replied,—</p>

<p>“Because she loves him best of anybody in
the world.”</p>

<p>“Better’n <i>me</i>?” said Lucy, looking for her
handkerchief.</p>

<p>The good clergyman tried to explain to his
children that there are many kinds of love
in the world, but all are beautiful and sweet.
Then he talked of Christmas, and of God’s
sending his blessed Son to us upon that
day, a little child.</p>

<p>“God’s love is best of all,” said Mr. Dunlee.
“Did you ever fancy for a moment, little
ones, what we should do without our Father’s
love?”</p>

<p>“Die, <i>I</i> think,” replied Jimmy, shivering
and drawing nearer to his little sister. “We
should all cuddle up together and die in a
heap.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>But Lucy could talk of nothing but the
wedding.</p>

<p>“Auntie never telled me a thing. Did she
mally Mr. Sanford ’cause she loved him?”</p>

<p>“To be sure,” said Mr. Dunlee.</p>

<p>Lucy drew a quick breath.</p>

<p>“Well, I love my brother better’n that; I
love him ’way up to the moon. Won’t you
mally me and my brother?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” laughed papa. “Put down your
cake, and stand up here, both of you.”</p>

<p>They stood up. It was a lovely sight as
the full light of the chandelier shone down
upon them in their bridal array, and turned
the hair of both to shining gold.</p>

<p>“I pronounce you brother and sister,”
said Mr. Dunlee.</p>

<p>And then he laid his hands upon their
innocent heads in silent blessing. They did
not know what he said, for he said it only
to God; but they were both very happy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now you are bound to each other by a
chain of love,” said mamma, embracing them.
“I hope you will be more brotherly, Jimmy-boy,
every time you think of it; and I hope
you’ll be more sisterly, my little Lucy.”</p>

<p>“So we’ve finished off with a wee wedding,”
said Aunt Jessie Pauly.</p>

<p>And the other guests responded,—</p>

<p>“How beautiful!” and drank healths to
“the bonnie wee pair,” who were proud to be
the centre of notice at last.</p>

till I put my hand in my pocket.’ The youth laughed, but for the sake, of
‘making a trade’ set down his basket and took the ‘enfant terrible.’ There
was an instant attack upon his hair, which was so long and straggling as to
prove an easy prey to the enemy.”</p>
